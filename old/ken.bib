abstract="This paper describes a case study of software engineers developing a library of software components for a group of research scientists, using a traditional, staged, document-led methodology. The case study reveals two problems with the use of the methodology. The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.",

keywords = "Software repositories mining, Semi-supervised topic modeling, LDA, Change message",
abstract = "Context
Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have demonstrated success in mining software repository tasks. Understanding software change messages described by the unstructured nature-language text is one of the fundamental challenges in mining these messages in repositories.
Objective
We seek to present a novel automatic change message classification method characterized by semi-supervised topic semantic analysis.
Method
In this work, we present a semi-supervised LDA based approach to automatically classify change messages. We use domain knowledge of software changes to make labeled samples which are added to build the semi-supervised LDA model. Next, we verify the cross-project analysis application of our method on three open-source projects. Our method has two advantages over existing software change classification methods: First of all, it mitigates the issue of how to set the appropriate number of latent topics. We do not have to choose the number of latent topics in our method, because it corresponds to the number of class labels. Second, this approach utilizes the information provided by the label samples in the training set.
Results
Our method automatically classified about 85% of the change messages in our experiment and our validation survey showed that 70.56% of the time our automatic classification results were in agreement with developer opinions.
Conclusion
Our approach automatically classifies most of the change messages which record the cause of the software change and the method is applicable to cross-project analysis of software change messages."

title="When Software Engineers Met Research Scientists: A Case Study",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2005",
abstract="This paper describes a case study of software engineers developing a library of software components for a group of research scientists, using a traditional, staged, document-led methodology. The case study reveals two problems with the use of the methodology. The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.",

title="When Software Engineers Met Research Scientists: A Case Study",
journal="EMSE",
year="2005",
abstract="This paper describes a case study of software engineers developing a library of software components for a group of research scientists, using a traditional, staged, document-led methodology. The case study reveals two problems with the use of the methodology. The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.",

abstract = "Context: Developers use bad code smells to guide code reorganization. Yet developers, textbooks, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are important. How can we offer reliable advice to developers about which bad smells to fix? Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a framework that analyzes a historical log of defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes. Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized (since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems). Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE’s recommendations for bad smell improvement against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules that are changed in response to XTREE’s recommendations contain significantly fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE endorses changes to very few code metrics, so XTREE requires programmers to do less work. Further, XTREE’s recommendations are more responsive to the particulars of different data sets. Finally XTREE’s recommendations may be generalized to identify the most crucial factors affecting multiple datasets (see the last figure in paper). Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell report, use a framework like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic methods."

title="Can traditional fault prediction models be used for vulnerability prediction?",
journal="EMSE",
year="2013",
abstract="Finding security vulnerabilities requires a different mindset than finding general faults in software---thinking like an attacker. Therefore, security engineers looking to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts may be better served by a prediction model that indicates security vulnerabilities rather than faults. At the same time, faults and vulnerabilities have commonalities that may allow development teams to use traditional fault prediction models and metrics for vulnerability prediction. The goal of our study is to determine whether fault prediction models can be used for vulnerability prediction or if specialized vulnerability prediction models should be developed when both models are built with traditional metrics of complexity, code churn, and fault history. We have performed an empirical study on a widely-used, large open source project, the Mozilla Firefox web browser, where 21{\%} of the source code files have faults and only 3{\%} of the files have vulnerabilities. Both the fault prediction model and the vulnerability prediction model provide similar ability in vulnerability prediction across a wide range of classification thresholds. For example, the fault prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 11{\%} at classification threshold 0.6 and the vulnerability prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 12{\%} at classification threshold 0.5. Our results suggest that fault prediction models based upon traditional metrics can substitute for specialized vulnerability prediction models. However, both fault prediction and vulnerability prediction models require significant improvement to reduce false positives while providing high recall.",

title="Random Forests",
journal="Machine Learning",

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2018",
abstract="Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents, combining and parametrizing the most efficient active learning algorithms. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovi{\'{c}}, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95{\%} relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20--50{\%} fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.",
