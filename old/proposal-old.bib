Both form a set of classifiers that are combined by voting, bagging by generating replicated bootstrap samples of the data, and boosting by adjusting the weights of training instances. This paper reports results of applying both techniques to a system that learns decision trees and testing on a representative collection of datasets. While both approaches substantially improve predictive accuracy, boosting shows the greater benefit. On the other hand, boosting also produces severe degradation on some datasets. A small change to the way that boosting combines the votes of learned classifiers reduces this downside and also leads to slightly better results on most of the datasets considered.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 1}, pages = {725–730}, numpages = {6}, location = {Portland, Oregon}, series = {AAAI'96} }

  abstract = {Today, software systems that rely on data are ubiquitous, and
  ensuring the data's quality is an increasingly important challenge as data
  errors result in annual multi-billion dollar losses. While software
  debugging and testing have received heavy research attention, less effort
  has been devoted to data debugging: identifying system errors caused by
  well-formed but incorrect data. We present continuous data testing (CDT), a
  low-overhead, delay-free technique that quickly identifies likely data
  errors. CDT continuously executes domain-specific test queries; when a test
  fails, CDT unobtrusively warns the user or administrator. We implement CDT
  in the ConTest prototype for the PostgreSQL database management system. A
  feasibility user study with 96 humans shows that ConTest was extremely
  effective in a setting with a data entry application at guarding against
  data errors: With ConTest, users corrected 98.4% of their errors, as
  opposed to 40.2% without, even when we injected 40% false positives into
  ConTest's output. Further, when using ConTest, users corrected data entry
  errors 3.2 times faster than when using state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {<p>Recent research in automated program repair has shown
  promise for reducing the significant manual effort debugging requires. This
  paper addresses a deficit of earlier evaluations of automated repair
  techniques caused by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches'
  correctness using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect
  metric of program correctness, evaluations of this type do not discriminate
  between correct patches, and patches that overfit the available tests and
  break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two
  well-studied repair tools, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, on a 956-bug dataset,
  each with a human-written patch. By evaluating patches on tests independent
  from those used during repair, we find that the tools are unlikely to
  improve the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of
  the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used during
  repair. For programs with fewer bugs, the tools are as likely to break
  tests as to fix them. However, novice developers also overfit, and
  automated repair can, under the right conditions, outperform these
  developers. In addition to overfitting, we measure the effects of test
  suite coverage, test suite provenance, starting program quality, and the
  difference in quality between novice-developer-written and tool-generated
  patches when quality is assessed with an independent test suite from patch
  generation. We have released the 956-bug dataset to allow future
  evaluations of new repair tools.</p>},

  abstract = {Most existing software tools and environments help developers
  analyze the present and past development states of their software systems,
  but few approaches have investigated the potential consequences of
  \emph{future} actions the developers may perform. The commoditization of
  hardware, multi-core architectures, and cloud computing provide new
  potential for delivering apparently-instantaneous feedback to developers,
  informing them of the effects of changes to the software that they may be
  considering.

  For example, modern IDEs often provide ``quick fix'' suggestions for
  resolving compilation errors. Developers must scan this list and select the
  option they think will resolve the problem. Instead, we propose that the IDE
  should speculatively perform each of the suggestions and provide information
  that helps developers select the best option for the given context. We
  believe the feedback enabled by speculative operations can lead to increased
  developer productivity and software quality.},

  because developers have inconsistent copies of a shared project. We present
  an approach to help developers identify and resolve conflicts early, before
  those conflicts become severe and before relevant changes fade away in the
  developers' memories. This paper presents three results.

  First, a study of open-source systems establishes that conflicts are
  frequent, persistent, and appear not only as overlapping textual edits but
  also as subsequent build and test failures. The study spans nine open-source
  systems totaling 3.4 million lines of code; our conflict data is derived
  from 550,000 development versions of the systems.

  Second, using previously-unexploited information, we precisely diagnose
  important classes of conflicts using the novel technique of speculative
  analysis over version control operations.

  Third, we describe the design of Crystal, a publicly-available tool that
  uses speculative analysis to make concrete advice unobtrusively available to
  developers, helping them identify, manage, and prevent conflicts.},

  Motivated by this finding, we develop a speculative analysis technique that

  abstract = {Modern integrated development environments recommend and
  automate common tasks, such as refactorings, auto-completions, and error
  corrections. However, these tools present little or no information about the
  consequences of the recommended changes. For example, a rename refactoring
  may: (1) modify the source code without changing program semantics, (2)
  modify the source code and (incorrectly) change program semantics, (3)
  modify the source code and (incorrectly) create compilation errors, (4) show
  a name collision warning and require developer input, or (5) show an error
  and not change the source code. Having to compute the consequences of a
  recommendation --- either mentally or by making source code changes --- puts
  an extra burden on the developers.
  
  This paper aims to reduce this burden with a technique that informs
  developers of the consequences of code transformations. Taking Eclipse Quick
  Fix as an example, we build a plug-in, Quick Fix Scout, that computes the
  consequences of Quick Fix recommendations. Our experiments with 20 users
  demonstrate that developers complete compilation-error removal tasks 10%
  faster when using Quick Fix Scout than Eclipse's Quick Fix.},

  abstract =	 {The structure of a software system
                  has a major impact on its
                  maintainability. To improve
                  maintainability, software systems
                  are usually organized into
                  subsystems using the constructs of
                  packages or modules. However,
                  during software evolution the
                  structure of the system undergoes
                  continuous modifications, drifting
                  away from its original design,
                  often reducing its quality. In
                  this paper we propose an approach
                  for helping maintainers to improve
                  the quality of software
                  modularization. The proposed
                  approach analyzes the (structural
                  and semantic) relationships
                  between classes in a package
                  identifying chains of strongly
                  related classes. The identified
                  chains are used to define new
                  packages with higher cohesion than
                  the original package. The proposed
                  approach has been empirical
                  evaluated through a case
                  study. The context of the study is
                  represented by an open source
                  system, JHotDraw, and two software
                  systems developed by teams of
                  students at the University of
                  Salerno. The analysis of the
                  results reveals that the proposed
                  approach generates meaningful
                  re-modularization of the studied
                  systems, which can lead to higher
                  quality.},

  abstract =	 {Changes during software evolution
                  and poor design decisions often
                  lead to packages that are hard to
                  understand and maintain, because
                  they usually group together
                  classes with unrelated
                  responsibilities. One way to
                  improve such packages is to
                  decompose them into smaller, more
                  cohesive packages. The difficulty
                  lies in the fact that most
                  definitions and interpretations of
                  cohesion are rather vague and the
                  multitude of measures proposed by
                  researchers usually capture only
                  one aspect of cohesion. We propose
                  a new technique for automatic
                  re-modularization of packages,
                  which uses structural and semantic
                  measures to decompose a package
                  into smaller, more cohesive
                  ones. The paper presents the new
                  approach as well as an empirical
                  study, which evaluates the
                  decompositions proposed by the new
                  technique. The results of the
                  evaluation indicate that the
                  decomposed packages have better
                  cohesion without a deterioration
                  of coupling and the
                  re-modularizations proposed by the
                  tool are also meaningful from a
                  functional point of view.},

                  are inevitable. These changes may
                  lead to design erosion and the
                  introduction of inadequate design
                  solutions, such as design
                  antipatterns. Several empirical
                  studies provide evidence that the
                  presence of antipatterns is
                  generally associated with lower

                  results from two surveys related
                  to data science applied to
                  software engineering. The first
                  survey solicited questions that
                  software engineers would like data
                  scientists to in-vestigate about
                  software, about software processes
                  and practices, and about software
                  engineers. Our analyses resulted
                  in a list of 145 questions grouped
                  into 12 categories. The second
                  survey asked a different pool of
                  software engineers to rate these
                  145 questions and identify the
                  most important ones to work on
                  first. Respondents fa-vored
                  questions that focus on how
                  customers typically use their
                  ap-plications. We also saw
                  opposition to questions that
                  assess the per-formance of
                  individual employees or compare
                  them with one an-other. Our
                  categorization and catalog of 145
                  questions can help re-searchers,

Software metrics are quantitative standards of measurement for various aspects of software projects. A well-designed metrics program will support decision making by management and enhance return on the IT investment. There are many aspects of software projects that can be measured, but not all aspects are worth measuring. Starting a new metrics program or improving a current program consists of five steps: identify business goals; select metrics; gather historical data; automate measurement procedures; and use metrics in decision making},

@inproceedings{He2013,
abstract = {The fundamental issue in cross project defect prediction is selecting the most appropriate training data for creating quality defect predictors. Another concern is whether historical data of open-source projects can be used to create quality predictors for proprietary projects from a practical point-of-view. Current studies have proposed statistical approaches to finding these training data, however, thus far no apparent effort has been made to study their success on proprietary data. Also these methods apply brute force techniques which are computationally expensive. In this work we introduce a novel data selection procedure which takes into account the similarities between the distribution of the test and potential training data. Additionally we use feature subset selection to increase the similarity between the test and training sets. Our procedure provides a comparable and scalable means of solving the cross project defect prediction problem for creating quality defect predictors. To evaluate our procedure we conducted empirical studies with comparisons to the within company defect prediction and a relevancy filtering method. We found that our proposed method performs relatively better than the filtering method in terms of both computation cost and prediction performance.},

abstract = {When projects lack sufficient local data to make predictions, they try to transfer information from other projects. How can we best support this process? In the field of software engineering, transfer learning has been shown to be effective for defect prediction. This paper checks whether it is possible to build transfer learners for software effort estimation. We use data on 154 projects from 2 sources to investigate transfer learning between different time intervals and 195 projects from 51 sources to provide evidence on the value of transfer learning for traditional cross-company learning problems. We find that the same transfer learning method can be useful for transfer effort estimation results for the cross-company learning problem and the cross-time learning problem. It is misguided to think that: (1) Old data of an organization is irrelevant to current context or (2) data of another organization cannot be used for local solutions. Transfer learning is a promising research direction that transfers relevant cross data between time intervals and domains.},

Among state-of-the-art stacking methods, stacking with probability distributions and multi-response linear regression performs best. We propose two extensions of this method, one using an extended set of meta-level features and the other using multi-response model trees to learn at the meta-level. We show that the latter extension performs better than existing stacking approaches and better than selecting the best classifier by cross validation.",

   abstract = {Software systems are designed and engineered to process data. However, software is data too. The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. Software evolution is no longer just about writing code, it is becoming an information management problem.
Analysis and management of the software data are activities that software engineers are not trained to do. We have to look for solutions outside software engineering, adopt them, and make them our own. These solutions can come from data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, statistical analysis, etc. This is not the first time software engineers are looking at such solutions. It has been going on for about two decades, in a form or another. The results so far indicate that software engineering is facing a paradigm shift, where more and more software engineering tasks are reinterpreted as optimization, search, retrieval, or classification problems. Despite this experience, applications of data analysis, data integration, and data mining in software engineering are in their infancy by comparison with other research fields. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created. This research has to be supported by integration with software development processes and with education as well. More than that, in order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners.
The talk will focus on arguing for and mapping out (part of) this research agenda, while looking back at (some of) the existing work in the area.},

  abstract =	 {The power of human computation is
                  founded on the capabilities of
                  humans to process qualitative
                  information in a manner that is
                  hard to reproduce with a
                  computer. However, all machine
                  learning algorithms rely on
                  mathematical operations, such as
                  sums, averages, least squares
                  etc. that are less suitable for
                  human computation. This paper is
                  an effort to combine these two
                  aspects of data processing. We
                  consider the problem of computing
                  a centroid of a data set, a key
                  component in many data-analysis
                  applications such as clustering,
                  using a very simple human
                  intelligence task (HIT). In this
                  task the workers must choose the
                  outlier from a set of three
                  items. After presenting a number
                  of such triplets to the workers,
                  the item chosen the least number
                  of times as the outlier is
                  selected as the centroid. We
                  provide a proof that the centroid
                  determined by this procedure is
                  equal the mean of a univariate
                  normal distribution. Furthermore,
                  as a demonstration of the
                  viability of our method, we
                  implement a human computation
                  based variant of the k-means
                  clustering algorithm. We present
                  experiments where the proposed
                  method is used to find an
                  "average" image in a collection,
                  and cluster images to semantic
                  categories.},

In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

  abstract =	 {Background: There are too many
                  design options for software effort
                  estimators. How can we best
                  explore them all? Aim: We seek
                  aspects on general principles of
                  effort estimation that can guide
                  the design of effort
                  estimators. Method: We identified
                  the essential assumption of
                  analogy-based effort estimation,
                  i.e., the immediate neighbors of a
                  project offer stable conclusions
                  about that project. We test that
                  assumption by generating a binary
                  tree of clusters of effort data
                  and comparing the variance of
                  supertrees versus smaller
                  subtrees. Results: For 10 data
                  sets (from Coc81, Nasa93,
                  Desharnais, Albrecht, ISBSG, and
                  data from Turkish companies), we
                  found: 1) The estimation variance
                  of cluster subtrees is usually
                  larger than that of cluster
                  supertrees; 2) if analogy is
                  restricted to the cluster trees
                  with lower variance, then effort
                  estimates have a significantly
                  lower error (measured using MRE,
                  AR, and Pred(25) with a Wilcoxon
                  test, 95 percent confidence,
                  compared to nearest neighbor
                  methods that use neighborhoods of
                  a fixed size). Conclusion:
                  Estimation by analogy can be
                  significantly improved by a
                  dynamic selection of nearest
                  neighbors, using only the project
                  data from regions with small
                  variance.},

  abstract =	 {We offer a case study illustrating
                  three rules for reporting research
                  to industrial
                  practitioners. Firstly, report
                  'relevant' results; e.g. this
                  paper explores the effects of
                  distributed development on
                  software products. Second:
                  'recheck' old results if new
                  results call them into
                  question. Many papers say
                  distributed development can be
                  harmful to software
                  quality. Previous work by Bird et
                  al. allayed that concern but a
                  recent paper by Posnett et
                  al. suggests that the Bird result
                  was biased by the kinds of files
                  it explored. Hence, this paper
                  rechecks that result and finds
                  significant differences in
                  Microsoft products (Office 2010)
                  between software built by
                  distributed or collocated
                  teams. At first glance, this
                  recheck calls into question the
                  widespread practice of distributed
                  development. Our third rule is to
                  'reflect' on results to avoid
                  confusing practitioners with an
                  arcane mathematical analysis. For
                  example, on reflection, we found
                  that the effect size of the
                  differences seen in the collocated
                  and distributed software was so
                  small that it need not concern
                  industrial practitioners. Our
                  conclusion is that at least for
                  Microsoft products, distributed
                  development is not considered
                  harmful. © 2013 IEEE.},

                  Sharing Data and Models, we show
                  that sharing all data is less
                  useful that sharing just the
                  relevant data. There are several
                  useful methods for finding those
                  relevant data regions including
                  simple nearest neighbor, or kNN,
                  algorithms; clustering (to
                  optimize subsequent kNN); and
                  pruning away “bad” regions. Also,
                  we show that with clustering, it

abstract="Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.",

@article{Tong2001,
  abstract =	 {Support vector machines have met
                  with significant success in
                  numerous real-world learning
                  tasks. However, like most machine
                  learning algorithms, they are
                  generally applied using a randomly
                  selected training set classified
                  in advance. In many settings, we
                  also have the option ofusing
                  pool-based active
                  learning. Instead ofusing a
                  randomly selected training set,
                  the learner has access to a pool
                  ofunlabeled instances and can
                  request the labels for some number
                  of them. We introduce a new
                  algorithm for performing active
                  learning with support vector
                  machines, i.e., an algorithm for
                  choosing which instances to
                  request next. We provide a
                  theoretical motivation for the
                  algorithm using the notion of a
                  version space. We present
                  experimental results showing that
                  employing our active learning
                  method can significantly reduce
                  the need for labeled training
                  instances in both the standard
                  inductive and transductive

  abstract =	 {<p>In this paper, we present the
                  results from two surveys related
                  to data science applied to
                  software engineering. The first
                  survey solicited questions that
                  software engineers would like data
                  scientists to investigate about
                  software, about software processes
                  and practices, and about software
                  engineers. Our analyses resulted
                  in a list of 145 questions grouped
                  into 12 categories. The second
                  survey asked a different pool of
                  software engineers to rate these
                  145 questions and identify the
                  most important ones to work on
                  first. Respondents favored
                  questions that focus on how
                  customers typically use their
                  applications.  We also saw
                  opposition to questions that
                  assess the performance of
                  individual employees or compare
                  them with one another. Our
                  categorization and catalog of 145
                  questions can help researchers,
                  practitioners, and educators to
                  more easily focus their efforts on
                  topics that are important to the
                  software industry.</p> <p>The data

@inproceedings{me08d,
  abstract =	 {Context: There are many methods
                  that input static code features
                  and output a predictor for faulty
                  code modules. These data mining
                  methods have hit a "performance
                  ceiling"; i.e., some inherent
                  upper bound on the amount of
                  information offered by, say,
                  static code features when
                  identifying modules which contain
                  faults. Objective: We seek an
                  explanation for this ceiling
                  effect. Perhaps static code
                  features have "limited information
                  content"; i.e. their information
                  can be quickly and completely
                  discovered by even simple
                  learners. Method: An initial
                  literature review documents the
                  ceiling effect in other
                  work. Next, using three
                  sub-sampling techniques (under-,
                  over-, and micro-sampling), we
                  look for the lower useful bound on
                  the number of training
                  instances. Results: Using
                  micro-sampling, we find that as
                  few as 50 instances yield as much
                  information as larger training
                  sets. Conclusions: We have found
                  much evidence for the limited
                  information hypothesis. Further
                  progress in learning defect
                  predictors may not come from
                  better algorithms. Rather, we need
                  to be improving the information
                  content of the training data,
                  perhaps with case-based reasoning
                  methods. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {In mission critical systems, such as those developed by NASA, it is very important that the test engineers properly recognize the severity of each issue they identify during testing. Proper severity assessment is essential for appropriate resource allocation and planning for fixing activities and additional testing. Severity assessment is strongly influenced by the experience of the test engineers and by the time they spend on each issue. The paper presents a new and automated method named SEVERIS (severity issue assessment), which assists the test engineer in assigning severity levels to defect reports. SEVERIS is based on standard text mining and machine learning techniques applied to existing sets of defect reports. A case study on using SEVERIS with data from NASApsilas Project and Issue Tracking System (PITS) is presented in the paper. The case study results indicate that SEVERIS is a good predictor for issue severity levels, while it is easy to use and efficient.},

                  Data Science for Software
                  Engineering: Sharing Data and
                  Models, explores ensemble learners
                  and multi-objective optimizers as
                  applied to software
                  engineering. Novel incremental
                  ensemble learners are explained
                  along with one of the largest
                  ensemble learning (in effort
                  estimation) experiments yet
                  attempted. It turns out that the
                  specific goals of the learning has
                  an effect on what is learned and,
                  for this reason, this part also
                  explores multi-goal reasoning. We
                  show that multi-goal optimizers
                  can significantly improve effort
                  estimation results. },

keywords = "Software repositories mining, Semi-supervised topic modeling, LDA, Change message",
abstract = "Context
Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have demonstrated success in mining software repository tasks. Understanding software change messages described by the unstructured nature-language text is one of the fundamental challenges in mining these messages in repositories.
Objective
We seek to present a novel automatic change message classification method characterized by semi-supervised topic semantic analysis.
Method
In this work, we present a semi-supervised LDA based approach to automatically classify change messages. We use domain knowledge of software changes to make labeled samples which are added to build the semi-supervised LDA model. Next, we verify the cross-project analysis application of our method on three open-source projects. Our method has two advantages over existing software change classification methods: First of all, it mitigates the issue of how to set the appropriate number of latent topics. We do not have to choose the number of latent topics in our method, because it corresponds to the number of class labels. Second, this approach utilizes the information provided by the label samples in the training set.
Results
Our method automatically classified about 85% of the change messages in our experiment and our validation survey showed that 70.56% of the time our automatic classification results were in agreement with developer opinions.
Conclusion
Our approach automatically classifies most of the change messages which record the cause of the software change and the method is applicable to cross-project analysis of software change messages."

abstract = "Context: Developers use bad code smells to guide code reorganization. Yet developers, textbooks, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are important. How can we offer reliable advice to developers about which bad smells to fix? Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a framework that analyzes a historical log of defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes. Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized (since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems). Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE’s recommendations for bad smell improvement against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules that are changed in response to XTREE’s recommendations contain significantly fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE endorses changes to very few code metrics, so XTREE requires programmers to do less work. Further, XTREE’s recommendations are more responsive to the particulars of different data sets. Finally XTREE’s recommendations may be generalized to identify the most crucial factors affecting multiple datasets (see the last figure in paper). Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell report, use a framework like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic methods."

title="Can traditional fault prediction models be used for vulnerability prediction?",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2013",
month="Feb",
day="01",
volume="18",
number="1",
pages="25--59",
abstract="Finding security vulnerabilities requires a different mindset than finding general faults in software---thinking like an attacker. Therefore, security engineers looking to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts may be better served by a prediction model that indicates security vulnerabilities rather than faults. At the same time, faults and vulnerabilities have commonalities that may allow development teams to use traditional fault prediction models and metrics for vulnerability prediction. The goal of our study is to determine whether fault prediction models can be used for vulnerability prediction or if specialized vulnerability prediction models should be developed when both models are built with traditional metrics of complexity, code churn, and fault history. We have performed an empirical study on a widely-used, large open source project, the Mozilla Firefox web browser, where 21{\%} of the source code files have faults and only 3{\%} of the files have vulnerabilities. Both the fault prediction model and the vulnerability prediction model provide similar ability in vulnerability prediction across a wide range of classification thresholds. For example, the fault prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 11{\%} at classification threshold 0.6 and the vulnerability prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 12{\%} at classification threshold 0.5. Our results suggest that fault prediction models based upon traditional metrics can substitute for specialized vulnerability prediction models. However, both fault prediction and vulnerability prediction models require significant improvement to reduce false positives while providing high recall.",

Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {2546–2554}, numpages = {9}, location = {Granada, Spain}, series = {NIPS'11} }

abstract="Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents, combining and parametrizing the most efficient active learning algorithms. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovi{\'{c}}, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95{\%} relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20--50{\%} fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.",

abstract = "Multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithms are based on the optimization of several objective functions that guide the search following a cycle based on evolutionary algorithms. Their capabilities allow them to find better solutions than with conventional clustering algorithms when more than one criterion is necessary to obtain understandable patterns from the data. However, these kind of techniques are expensive in terms of computational time and memory usage, and specific strategies are required to ensure their successful scalability when facing large-scale data sets. This work proposes the application of a data subset approach for scaling-up multiobjective clustering algorithms and it also analyzes the impact of three stratification methods. The experiments show that the use of the proposed data subset approach improves the performance of multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithms without considerably penalizing the accuracy of the final clustering solution."

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

@inproceedings{krishna16,
	abstract = {Transfer learning: is the process of translating quality predictors learned in one data set to another. Transfer learning has been the subject of much recent research. In practice, that research means changing models all the time as transfer learners continually exchange new models to the current project. This paper offers a very simple bellwether transfer learner. Given N data sets, we find which one produce the best predictions on all the others. This bellwether data set is then used for all subsequent predictions (or, until such time as its predictions start failing-- at which point it is wise to seek another bellwether). Bellwethers are interesting since they are very simple to find (just wrap a for-loop around standard data miners). Also, they simplify the task of making general policies in SE since as long as one bellwether remains useful, stable conclusions for N data sets can be achieved just by reasoning over that bellwether. From this, we conclude (1) this bellwether method is a useful (and very simple) transfer learning method; (2) bellwethers are a baseline method against which future transfer learners should be compared; (3) sometimes, when building increasingly complex automatic methods, researchers should pause and compare their supposedly more sophisticated method against simpler alternatives.},

 abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

 abstract = {One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is concept location in source code. In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

We formulate fairness as an optimization problem of finding a  good representation of the data with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group.  We show positive results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets.  Moreover, we demonstrate several advantages to our approach.  First, our intermediate representation can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer  learning is possible); secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important dimensions of the data for classification.}

booktitle="Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases",
year="2012",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
abstract="With the spread of data mining technologies and the accumulation of social data, such technologies and data are being used for determinations that seriously affect individuals' lives. For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.",

One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",
