abstract = {The ever-increasing number of computing devices around us results in more and more systems competing for our attention, making cognitive workload a crucial factor for the user experience of human-computer interfaces. Research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has used various metrics to determine users’ mental demands. However, there needs to be a systematic way to choose an appropriate and effective measure for cognitive workload in experimental setups, posing a challenge to their reproducibility. We present a literature survey of past and current metrics for cognitive workload used throughout HCI literature to address this challenge. By initially exploring what cognitive workload resembles in the HCI context, we derive a categorization supporting researchers and practitioners in selecting cognitive workload metrics for system design and evaluation. We conclude with three following research gaps: (1) defining and interpreting cognitive workload in HCI, (2) the hidden cost of the NASA-TLX, and (3) HCI research as a catalyst for workload-aware systems, highlighting that HCI research has to deepen and conceptualize the understanding of cognitive workload in the context of interactive computing systems.},

abstract = {Although satellite images can provide more information about the earth’s surface in a relatively short time and over a large scale, they are affected by observation conditions and the accuracy of the image acquisition equipment. The objects on the images are often not clear and uncertain, especially at their borders. The type-1 fuzzy set based fuzzy clustering technique allows each data pattern to belong to many different clusters through membership function (MF) values, which can handle data patterns with unclear and uncertain boundaries well. However, this technique is quite sensitive to noise, outliers, and limitations in handling uncertainties. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a hybrid method encompassing interval type-2 semi-supervised possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering (IT2SPFCM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to form the proposed IT2SPFCM-PSO. We experimented on some satellite images to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the IT2SPFCM-PSO algorithm gives accuracy from 98.8% to 99.39% and is higher than that of other matching algorithms including SFCM, SMKFCM, SIIT2FCM, PFCM, SPFCM-W, SPFCM-SS, and IT2SPFCM. Analysis of the results by indicators PC-I, CE-I, D-I, XB-I, t -I, and MSE also showed that the proposed method gives better results in most experiments.}

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

In this work we use lexical sentiment analysis to study emotions expressed in commit comments of different open source projects and analyze their relationship with different factors such as used programming language, time and day of the week in which the commit was made, team distribution and project approval. Our results show that projects developed in Java tend to have more negative commit comments, and that projects that have more distributed teams tend to have a higher positive polarity in their emotional content. Additionally, we found that commit comments written on Mondays tend to a more negative emotion. While our results need to be confirmed by a more representative sample they are an initial step into the study of emotions and related factors in open source projects. },

ABSTRACT={To ultimately combat the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, it is desired to develop an effective and safe vaccine against this highly contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. However, these vaccine candidates might lack the induction of complete protection and have safety concerns. We then applied the Vaxign and the newly developed machine learning-based Vaxign-ML reverse vaccinology tools to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Our Vaxign analysis found that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence is conserved with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not from the other four human coronaviruses causing mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10), were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and the predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be localized on the surface of the protein. Our predicted vaccine targets have the potential for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine development. We also propose that an “Sp/Nsp cocktail vaccine” containing a structural protein(s) (Sp) and a non-structural protein(s) (Nsp) would stimulate effective complementary immune responses.}

abstract = {Code reuse is a form of knowledge reuse in software development that is fundamental to innovation in many fields. However, to date there has been no systematic investigation of code reuse in open source software projects. This study uses quantitative and qualitative data gathered from a sample of six open source software projects to explore two sets of research questions derived from the literature on software reuse in firms and open source software development. We find that code reuse is extensive across the sample and that open source software developers, much like developers in firms, apply tools that lower their search costs for knowledge and code, assess the quality of software components, and have incentives to reuse code. Open source software developers reuse code because they want to integrate functionality quickly, because they want to write preferred code, because they operate under limited resources in terms of time and skills, and because they can mitigate development costs through code reuse.},

abstract = {Background: Projects of all sizes and impact are leveraging the services of the social coding platform GitHub to collaborate. Since users' information and actions are recorded, GitHub has been mined for over 6 years now to investigate aspects of the collaborative open source software (OSS) development paradigm. Aim: In this research, we use this data to investigate the relation between project growth as a proxy for success, and social diversity. Method: We first categorize active OSS projects into a five-star rating using a benchmarking system we based on various project growth metrics; then we study the relation between this rating and the reported social diversities for the team members of those projects. Results: Our findings highlight a statistically significant relation; however, the effect is small. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the need for further research on this topic; moreover, the proposed benchmarking method may be used in future work to determine OSS project success on collaboration platforms such as GitHub.},

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components – models may be ``entangled'' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.},

abstract = "Context
Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have demonstrated success in mining software repository tasks. Understanding software change messages described by the unstructured nature-language text is one of the fundamental challenges in mining these messages in repositories.
Objective
We seek to present a novel automatic change message classification method characterized by semi-supervised topic semantic analysis.
Method
In this work, we present a semi-supervised LDA based approach to automatically classify change messages. We use domain knowledge of software changes to make labeled samples which are added to build the semi-supervised LDA model. Next, we verify the cross-project analysis application of our method on three open-source projects. Our method has two advantages over existing software change classification methods: First of all, it mitigates the issue of how to set the appropriate number of latent topics. We do not have to choose the number of latent topics in our method, because it corresponds to the number of class labels. Second, this approach utilizes the information provided by the label samples in the training set.
Results
Our method automatically classified about 85% of the change messages in our experiment and our validation survey showed that 70.56% of the time our automatic classification results were in agreement with developer opinions.
Conclusion
Our approach automatically classifies most of the change messages which record the cause of the software change and the method is applicable to cross-project analysis of software change messages."

abstract = {Product line (PL)-based development is a thriving research area to develop software-intensive systems. Feature models (FMs) facilitate derivation of valid products from a PL by managing commonalities and variabilities among software products. However, the researchers in academia as well as in the industries experience difficulties in quality assessment of FMs. The increasing complexity and size of FMs may lead to defects, which outweigh the benefits of PL. This paper provides a systematic literature review and key research issues related to the FM defects in PL. We derive a typology of FM defects according to their level of importance. The information on defects’ identification and explanations are provided with formalization. Further, corrective explanations are presented which incorporates various techniques used to fix defects with their implementation. This information would help software engineering community by enabling developers or modelers to find the types of defects and their causes and to choose an appropriate technique to fix defects in order to produce defect-free products from FMs, thereby enhancing the overall quality of PL-based development.},

abstract = "Context: Developers use bad code smells to guide code reorganization. Yet developers, textbooks, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are important. How can we offer reliable advice to developers about which bad smells to fix? Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a framework that analyzes a historical log of defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes. Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized (since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems). Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE’s recommendations for bad smell improvement against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules that are changed in response to XTREE’s recommendations contain significantly fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE endorses changes to very few code metrics, so XTREE requires programmers to do less work. Further, XTREE’s recommendations are more responsive to the particulars of different data sets. Finally XTREE’s recommendations may be generalized to identify the most crucial factors affecting multiple datasets (see the last figure in paper). Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell report, use a framework like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic methods."

title="Can traditional fault prediction models be used for vulnerability prediction?",
journal="EMSE",
year="2013",
abstract="Finding security vulnerabilities requires a different mindset than finding general faults in software---thinking like an attacker. Therefore, security engineers looking to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts may be better served by a prediction model that indicates security vulnerabilities rather than faults. At the same time, faults and vulnerabilities have commonalities that may allow development teams to use traditional fault prediction models and metrics for vulnerability prediction. The goal of our study is to determine whether fault prediction models can be used for vulnerability prediction or if specialized vulnerability prediction models should be developed when both models are built with traditional metrics of complexity, code churn, and fault history. We have performed an empirical study on a widely-used, large open source project, the Mozilla Firefox web browser, where 21{\%} of the source code files have faults and only 3{\%} of the files have vulnerabilities. Both the fault prediction model and the vulnerability prediction model provide similar ability in vulnerability prediction across a wide range of classification thresholds. For example, the fault prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 11{\%} at classification threshold 0.6 and the vulnerability prediction model provided recall of 83{\%} and precision of 12{\%} at classification threshold 0.5. Our results suggest that fault prediction models based upon traditional metrics can substitute for specialized vulnerability prediction models. However, both fault prediction and vulnerability prediction models require significant improvement to reduce false positives while providing high recall.",

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

abstract="Literature reviews can be time-consuming and tedious to complete. By cataloging and refactoring three state-of-the-art active learning techniques from evidence-based medicine and legal electronic discovery, this paper finds and implements FASTREAD, a faster technique for studying a large corpus of documents, combining and parametrizing the most efficient active learning algorithms. This paper assesses FASTREAD using datasets generated from existing SE literature reviews (Hall, Wahono, Radjenovi{\'{c}}, Kitchenham et al.). Compared to manual methods, FASTREAD lets researchers find 95{\%} relevant studies after reviewing an order of magnitude fewer papers. Compared to other state-of-the-art automatic methods, FASTREAD reviews 20--50{\%} fewer studies while finding same number of relevant primary studies in a systematic literature review.",

howpublished = {arXiv},
year = {2022},
month = {May},
abstract = {We introduce GODEL (Grounded Open Dialogue Language Model), a large pre-trained language model for dialog. In contrast with earlier models such as DialoGPT, GODEL leverages a new phase of grounded pre-training designed to better support adapting GODEL to a wide range of downstream dialog tasks that require information external to the current conversation (e.g., a database or document) to produce good responses. Experiments against an array of benchmarks that encompass task-oriented dialog, conversational QA, and grounded open-domain dialog show that GODEL outperforms state-of-the-art pre-trained dialog models in few-shot fine-tuning setups, in terms of both human and automatic evaluation. A novel feature of our evaluation methodology is the introduction of a notion of utility that assesses the usefulness of responses (extrinsic evaluation) in addition to their communicative features (intrinsic evaluation). We show that extrinsic evaluation offers improved inter-annotator agreement and correlation with automated metrics. Code and data processing scripts are publicly available.},

abstract = {Cunningham introduced the metaphor of technical debt as guidance for software developers that must trade engineering quality against short-term goals.We revisit the technical debt metaphor, and translate it into terms that can help IT executives better understand their IT investments. An approach is proposed to quantify debts (cost to fix technical quality issues) and interest (extra cost spent on maintenance due to technical quality issues). Our approach is based on an empirical assessment method of software quality developed at the Software Improvement Group (SIG). The core part of the technical debt calculation is constructed on the basis of empirical data of 44 systems that are currently being monitored by SIG.In a case study, we apply the approach to a real system, and discuss how the results provide useful insights on important questions related to IT investment such as the return on investment (ROI) in software quality improvement.},

abstract="Fault prediction by negative binomial regression models is shown to be effective for four large production software systems from industry. A model developed originally with data from systems with regularly scheduled releases was successfully adapted to a system without releases to identify 20{\%} of that system's files that contained 75{\%} of the faults. A model with a pre-specified set of variables derived from earlier research was applied to three additional systems, and proved capable of identifying averages of 81, 94 and 76{\%} of the faults in those systems. A primary focus of this paper is to investigate the impact on predictive accuracy of using data about the number of developers who access individual code units. For each system, including the cumulative number of developers who had previously modified a file yielded no more than a modest improvement in predictive accuracy. We conclude that while many factors can ``spoil the broth'' (lead to the release of software with too many defects), the number of developers is not a major influence.",

abstract="Previous research has provided evidence that a combination of static code metrics and software history metrics can be used to predict with surprising success which files in the next release of a large system will have the largest numbers of defects. In contrast, very little research exists to indicate whether information about individual developers can profitably be used to improve predictions. We investigate whether files in a large system that are modified by an individual developer consistently contain either more or fewer faults than the average of all files in the system. The goal of the investigation is to determine whether information about which particular developer modified a file is able to improve defect predictions. We also extend earlier research evaluating use of counts of the number of developers who modified a file as predictors of the file's future faultiness. We analyze change reports filed for three large systems, each containing 18 releases, with a combined total of nearly 4 million LOC and over 11,000 files. A buggy file ratio is defined for programmers, measuring the proportion of faulty files in Release R out of all files modified by the programmer in Release R-1. We assess the consistency of the buggy file ratio across releases for individual programmers both visually and within the context of a fault prediction model. Buggy file ratios for individual programmers often varied widely across all the releases that they participated in. A prediction model that takes account of the history of faulty files that were changed by individual developers shows improvement over the standard negative binomial model of less than 0.13{\%} according to one measure, and no improvement at all according to another measure. In contrast, augmenting a standard model with counts of cumulative developers changing files in prior releases produced up to a 2{\%} improvement in the percentage of faults detected in the top 20{\%} of predicted faulty files. The cumulative number of developers interacting with a file can be a useful variable for defect prediction. However, the study indicates that adding information to a model about which particular developer modified a file is not likely to improve defect predictions.",

abstract="Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.",

abstract = {Context
Software engineering has a problem in that when we empirically evaluate competing prediction systems we obtain conflicting results.
Objective
To reduce the inconsistency amongst validation study results and provide a more formal foundation to interpret results with a particular focus on continuous prediction systems.
Method
A new framework is proposed for evaluating competing prediction systems based upon (1) an unbiased statistic, Standardised Accuracy, (2) testing the result likelihood relative to the baseline technique of random ‘predictions’, that is guessing, and (3) calculation of effect sizes.
Results
Previously published empirical evaluations of prediction systems are re-examined and the original conclusions shown to be unsafe. Additionally, even the strongest results are shown to have no more than a medium effect size relative to random guessing.
Conclusions
Biased accuracy statistics such as MMRE are deprecated. By contrast this new empirical validation framework leads to meaningful results. Such steps will assist in performing future meta-analyses and in providing more robust and usable recommendations to practitioners.}

abstract = {Randomized algorithms have been used to successfully address many different types of software engineering problems. This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However, randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the use of randomized algorithms in selected software engineering venues in 2009. Its goal is not to perform a complete survey but to get a representative snapshot of current practice in software engineering research. We show that randomized algorithms are used in a significant percentage of papers but that, in most cases, randomness is not properly accounted for.This casts doubts on the validity of most empirical results assessing randomized algorithms. There are numerous statistical tests, based on different assumptions, and it is not always clear when and how to use these tests. We hence provide practical guidelines to support empirical research on randomized algorithms in software engineering},

abstract="Fault prediction by negative binomial regression models is shown to be effective for four large production software systems from industry. A model developed originally with data from systems with regularly scheduled releases was successfully adapted to a system without releases to identify 20{\%} of that system's files that contained 75{\%} of the faults. A model with a pre-specified set of variables derived from earlier research was applied to three additional systems, and proved capable of identifying averages of 81, 94 and 76{\%} of the faults in those systems. A primary focus of this paper is to investigate the impact on predictive accuracy of using data about the number of developers who access individual code units. For each system, including the cumulative number of developers who had previously modified a file yielded no more than a modest improvement in predictive accuracy. We conclude that while many factors can ``spoil the broth'' (lead to the release of software with too many defects), the number of developers is not a major influence.",

abstract = "Context
Software industry has widely adopted Agile software development methods. Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics.
Method
This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process.
Results
The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate.
Conclusion
The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry."

Several studies have validated that various metrics are useful indicators of maintenance effort in the procedural paradigm. However, software metrics have rarely been studied in the object-oriented paradigm. Very few metrics have been proposed to measure object-oriented systems, and the proposed ones have not been validated. This research concentrates on several object-oriented software metrics and the validation of these metrics with maintenance effort in two commercial systems. Statistical analyses of a prediction model incorporating 10 metrics were performed. In addition, a more compact model with fewer metrics is presented."

In other words, we wish to better understand the relationship between existing design measurement in OO systems and the quality of the software developed. The second goal is to propose an investigation and analysis strategy to make these kind of studies more repeatable and comparable, a problem which is pervasive in the literature on quality measurement. Results show that many of the measures capture similar dimensions in the data set, thus reflecting the fact that many of them are based on similar principles and hypotheses. However, it is shown that by using a subset of measures, accurate models can be built to predict which classes most of the faults are likely to lie in. When predicting fault-prone classes, the best model shows a percentage of correct classifications higher than 80% and finds more than 90% of faulty classes. Besides the size of classes, the frequency of method invocations and the depth of inheritance hierarchies seem to be the main driving factors of fault-proneness."

This means that if these faulty software components can be detected early in the development project's life cycle, mitigating actions can be taken, such as a redesign. For object-oriented applications, prediction models using design metrics can be used to identify faulty classes early on. In this paper we report on a study that used object-oriented design metrics to construct such prediction models. The study used data collected from one version of a commercial Java application for constructing a prediction model. The model was then validated on a subsequent release of the same application. Our results indicate that the prediction model has a high accuracy. Furthermore, we found that an export coupling (EC) metric had the strongest association with fault-proneness, indicating a structural feature that may be symptomatic of a class with a high probability of latent faults."

Decision support tools for this have been built using causal models represented by Bayesian Networks (BNs), incorporating empirical data and expert judgement. Previously, this required a custom BN for each development lifecycle. We describe a more general approach that allows causal models to be applied to any lifecycle. The approach evolved through collaborative projects and captures significant commercial input. For projects within the range of the models, defect predictions are very accurate. This approach enables decision-makers to reason in a way that is not possible with regression-based models."

abstract="There are lots of different software metrics discovered and used for defect prediction in the literature. Instead of dealing with so many metrics, it would be practical and easy if we could determine the set of metrics that are most important and focus on them more to predict defectiveness. We use Bayesian networks to determine the probabilistic influential relationships among software metrics and defect proneness. In addition to the metrics used in Promise data repository, we define two more metrics, i.e. NOD for the number of developers and LOCQ for the source code quality. We extract these metrics by inspecting the source code repositories of the selected Promise data repository data sets. At the end of our modeling, we learn the marginal defect proneness probability of the whole software system, the set of most effective metrics, and the influential relationships among metrics and defectiveness. Our experiments on nine open source Promise data repository data sets show that response for class (RFC), lines of code (LOC), and lack of coding quality (LOCQ) are the most effective metrics whereas coupling between objects (CBO), weighted method per class (WMC), and lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM) are less effective metrics on defect proneness. Furthermore, number of children (NOC) and depth of inheritance tree (DIT) have very limited effect and are untrustworthy. On the other hand, based on the experiments on Poi, Tomcat, and Xalan data sets, we observe that there is a positive correlation between the number of developers (NOD) and the level of defectiveness. However, further investigation involving a greater number of projects is needed to confirm our findings.",

abstract = "Context
Software defect prediction plays a crucial role in estimating the most defect-prone components of software, and a large number of studies have pursued improving prediction accuracy within a project or across projects. However, the rules for making an appropriate decision between within- and cross-project defect prediction when available historical data are insufficient remain unclear.
Objective
The objective of this work is to validate the feasibility of the predictor built with a simplified metric set for software defect prediction in different scenarios, and to investigate practical guidelines for the choice of training data, classifier and metric subset of a given project.
Method
First, based on six typical classifiers, three types of predictors using the size of software metric set were constructed in three scenarios. Then, we validated the acceptable performance of the predictor based on Top-k metrics in terms of statistical methods. Finally, we attempted to minimize the Top-k metric subset by removing redundant metrics, and we tested the stability of such a minimum metric subset with one-way ANOVA tests.
Results
The study has been conducted on 34 releases of 10 open-source projects available at the PROMISE repository. The findings indicate that the predictors built with either Top-k metrics or the minimum metric subset can provide an acceptable result compared with benchmark predictors. The guideline for choosing a suitable simplified metric set in different scenarios is presented in Table 12.
Conclusion
The experimental results indicate that (1) the choice of training data for defect prediction should depend on the specific requirement of accuracy; (2) the predictor built with a simplified metric set works well and is very useful in case limited resources are supplied; (3) simple classifiers (e.g., Naïve Bayes) also tend to perform well when using a simplified metric set for defect prediction; and (4) in several cases, the minimum metric subset can be identified to facilitate the procedure of general defect prediction with acceptable loss of prediction precision in practice."

abstract="Software code review, i.e., the practice of having other team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software domains. Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools.",

abstract="The knowledge about the software metrics which serve as defect indicators is vital for the efficient allocation of resources for quality assurance. It is the process metrics, although sometimes difficult to collect, which have recently become popular with regard to defect prediction. However, in order to identify rightly the process metrics which are actually worth collecting, we need the evidence validating their ability to improve the product metric-based defect prediction models. This paper presents an empirical evaluation in which several process metrics were investigated in order to identify the ones which significantly improve the defect prediction models based on product metrics. Data from a wide range of software projects (both, industrial and open source) were collected. The predictions of the models that use only product metrics (simple models) were compared with the predictions of the models which used product metrics, as well as one of the process metrics under scrutiny (advanced models). To decide whether the improvements were significant or not, statistical tests were performed and effect sizes were calculated. The advanced defect prediction models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Distinct Committers (NDC) were significantly better than the simple models without NDC, while the effect size was medium and the probability of superiority (PS) of the advanced models over simple ones was high ({\$}{\$}p=.016{\$}{\$}p=.016, {\$}{\$}r=-.29{\$}{\$}r=-.29, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}PS{\}}=.76{\$}{\$}PS=.76), which is a substantial finding useful in defect prediction. A similar result with slightly smaller PS was achieved by the advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally all of the investigated process metrics ({\$}{\$}p=.038{\$}{\$}p=.038, {\$}{\$}r=-.29{\$}{\$}r=-.29, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}PS{\}}=.68{\$}{\$}PS=.68). The advanced models trained on a data set containing product metrics and additionally Number of Modified Lines (NML) were significantly better than the simple models without NML, but the effect size was small ({\$}{\$}p=.038{\$}{\$}p=.038, {\$}{\$}r=.06{\$}{\$}r=.06). Hence, it is reasonable to recommend the NDC process metric in building the defect prediction models.",

However, with the aim of cost-effectiveness and timely management of resources, the software defects estimation in the early phases of software development life cycle (SDLC) is one of the major research areas. In this paper, a software defect estimation model is proposed using Bayesian belief network (BBN) and reliability relevant metrics of early phases of SDLC (e.g., requirement analysis, design and coding phases). The causal relationship of software metrics is modeled using BBN. The qualitative value of software metrics and expert assessment of software defects is used for developing the proposed model. The defects estimation accuracy of the proposed model is examined using qualitative data set of ten real software projects. The defects estimation results are compared with the existing model and found more accurate.",

abstract="Software quality is the fundamental requirement for a user, academia person, software developing organizations and researchers. In this paper a model for object-oriented Software Bug Prediction System (SBPS) has been developed. This model is capable of predicting the existence of bugs in a class if found, during software validation using metrics. The designed model forecasts the occurrences of bugs in a class when any new system is tested on it. For this experiment some open source similar types of defect datasets (projects) have been collected from Promise Software Engineering Repository. Some of these datasets have been selected for prediction of bugs, of which a few are not involved in model construction. First of all, we have formulated some hypotheses corresponding to each and every metric, and from metrics validation based on hypothesis basis finally 14 best suitable metrics have been selected for model creation. The Logistic Regression Classifier provides good accuracy among all classifiers. The proposed model is trained and tested on each of the validated dataset, including validated Combined Dataset separately too. The performance measure (accuracy) is computed in each case and finally it is found that the model provides overall averaged accuracy of 76.27{\%}.",

abstract="Software industries strive for software quality improvement by consistent bug prediction, bug removal and prediction of fault-prone module. This area has attracted researchers due to its significant involvement in software industries. Various techniques have been presented for software defect prediction. Recent researches have recommended data-mining using machine learning as an important paradigm for software bug prediction. state-of-art software defect prediction task suffer from various issues such as classification accuracy. However, software defect datasets are imbalanced in nature and known fault prone due to its huge dimension. To address this issue, here we present a combined approach for software defect prediction and prediction of software bugs. Proposed approach delivers a concept of feature reduction and artificial intelligence where feature reduction is carried out by well-known principle component analysis (PCA) scheme which is further improved by incorporating maximum-likelihood estimation for error reduction in PCA data reconstruction. Finally, neural network based classification technique is applied which shows prediction results. A framework is formulated and implemented on NASA software dataset where four datasets i.e., KC1, PC3, PC4 and JM1 are considered for performance analysis using MATLAB simulation tool. An extensive experimental study is performed where confusion, precision, recall, classification accuracy etc. parameters are computed and compared with existing software defect prediction techniques. Experimental study shows that proposed approach can provide better performance for software defect prediction.",

abstract="Context Applications of software have penetrated into every part of human life and have become significant in versatile areas. A case of negligence could cost a great loss of economy or even to life (Pentium FDIV bug ``Statistical Analysis of Floating Point Flaw: Intel White Paper'' (PDF) (2004) [1]; The Helminthiasis of the Internet [2]), and hence the reliability of the functions of an application is of extreme importance. A software error could be a deviation from the process flow, improper requirement definitions, or ambiguity in defining the constraints (IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology (1990) [3]). To avoid the lateral effects, the applications should be evaluated beforehand for all defects in all phases of the software cycle. Objective This paper emphasizes on the prediction of software defect density using weighted neural networks and comparison with the fuzzy logic-based approach. Method Each design phase is divided into the neural network node. Software metrics are chosen for each stage and fed into the nodes with a weight associated to it. Neural network system are associated with input layers, SW-DDC layer (stage-wise defect density calculation layer) and C-DDC (consolidated defect density calculation layer). Results The accuracy of the predicted defects is very close the actual defects. Validation results show this method is very accurate than the current methods like fuzzy implementation. Conclusion Weighted artificial networks is used to predict the software defect density and is been verified on different real-time data sets ranging from very low project sizes to the very high project size.",

title = {Making a Science of Model Search: Hyperparameter Optimization in Hundreds of Dimensions for Vision Architectures},
year = {2013},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

abstract = {There has been significant recent progress in reasoning and constraint processing methods. In areas such as planning and finite model-checking, current solution techniques can handle combinatorial problems with up to a million variables and five million constraints. The good scaling behavior of these methods appears to defy what one would expect based on a worst-case complexity analysis. In order to bridge this gap between theory and practice, we propose a new framework for studying the complexity of these techniques on practical problem instances. In particular, our approach incorporates general structural properties observed in practical problem instances into the formal complexity analysis. We introduce a notion of "backdoors", which are small sets of variables that capture the overall combinatorics of the problem instance. We provide empirical results showing the existence of such backdoors in real-world problems. We then present a series of complexity results that explain the good scaling behavior of current reasoning and constraint methods observed on practical problem instances.},

Such what-if queries can generate an overwhelming amount of data. We describe here a general method for understanding that data. Large-scale what-if queries can guide Monte Carlo simulations of a model. Machine learning can then be used to summarize the output. The summarization is an ensemble of decision trees. The TARZAN system can poll the ensemble looking for majority conclusions regarding what factors change the classifications of the data. TARZAN can succinctly present the results from very large what-if queries. For example, in one of the studies presented here, we can view on 1/2 a page the significant features from 109 what-ifs.},

abstract = {Bayesian optimization techniques have been successfully applied to robotics, planning, sensor placement, recommendation, advertising, intelligent user interfaces and automatic algorithm configuration. Despite these successes, the approach is restricted to problems of moderate dimension, and several workshops on Bayesian optimization have identified its scaling to high-dimensions as one of the holy grails of the field. In this paper, we introduce a novel random embedding idea to attack this problem. The resulting Random EMbedding Bayesian Optimization (REMBO) algorithm is very simple, has important invariance properties, and applies to domains with both categorical and continuous variables. We present a thorough theoretical analysis of REMBO. Empirical results confirm that REMBO can effectively solve problems with billions of dimensions, provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low. They also show that REMBO achieves state-of-the-art performance in optimizing the 47 discrete parameters of a popular mixed integer linear programming solver.},

capitalized. Because this is a patent request, the date filed fields are
used while the date fields are left empty/missing. In other countries,
the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.

standard, IEEE does not use the address for standards, but it is good
to provide one for BibTeX styles that use it.
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 451, reference #2.
@standard{IEEEexample:standard,

misc for a techreport like reference
techreport is not perfectly suitable because this entry lacks
an institution field

  author        = "L. Roberts",
  title         = "Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm {PRCA}",

Other unusual references

a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1725, reference #16.
@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"
}


an internet request for comments (RFC) as a misc entry type
It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,
  author        = "K. K. Ramakrishnan and S. Floyd",
  title         = "A Proposal to Add Explicit Congestion
                   Notification ({ECN}) to {IP}",
  howpublished  = "RFC 2481",
  month         = jan,
  year          = "1999"
}


a software package as a manual
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems", page 205, reference #20.
Sometimes they put the version/release information in the title.
@manual{IEEEexample:softmanual,
  title         = "SaberDesigner Reference Manual",
  organization  = "Analogy, Inc.",
  address       = "Beaverton, OR",
  year          = "1998",
  note          = "Release 4.3"
}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.
@electronic{IEEEexample:softonline,
  title         = "Ucb/lbnl/vint Network Simulator---ns (Version 2)",
  url           = "http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/ns/",
  key           = "ns"
}


misc for a German regulation
In German, the first letters of nouns are capitalized, so we do so here.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal in Selected Areas in
Communication", page 892, reference #9.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscgermanreg,
  title         = "{M}essung von {S}t{\"o}rfeldern an {A}nlagen 
                   und {L}eitungen der {T}elekommunikation im
                   {F}requenzbereich 9 {kHz} bis 3 {GHz}",
  language      = "german",
  howpublished  = "{M}e{\ss}vorschrift {R}eg {TP} {MV} 05",
  organization  = "Regulierungsbeh{\"o}rde f{\"u}r {T}elekommunikation und
                   {P}ost ({R}eg {TP})"
}



Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}








An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
@IEEEtranBSTCTL{IEEEexample:BSTcontrol,
  CTLuse_article_number     = "yes",
  CTLuse_paper              = "yes",

  CTLmax_names_forced_etal  = "10",

abstract = {Crowdtesting has become an effective alternative to traditional testing, especially for mobile applications. However, crowdtesting is hard to manage in nature. Given the complexity of mobile applications and unpredictability of distributed crowdtesting processes, it is difficult to estimate (a) remaining number of bugs yet to be detected or (b) required cost to find those bugs. Experience-based decisions may result in ineffective crowdtesting processes, e.g., there is an average of 32\% wasteful spending in current crowdtesting practices.This paper aims at exploring automated decision support to effectively manage crowdtesting processes. It proposes an approach named iSENSE which applies incremental sampling technique to process crowdtesting reports arriving in chronological order, organizes them into fixed-size groups as dynamic inputs, and predicts two test completion indicators in an incremental manner. The two indicators are: 1) total number of bugs predicted with Capture-ReCapture model, and 2) required test cost for achieving certain test objectives predicted with AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model. The evaluation of iSENSE is conducted on 46,434 reports of 218 crowdtesting tasks from one of the largest crowdtesting platforms in China. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through two application studies for automating crowdtesting management and semi-automation of task closing trade-off analysis. The results show that iSENSE can provide managers with greater awareness of testing progress to achieve cost-effectiveness gains of crowdtesting. Specifically, a median of 100\% bugs can be detected with 30\% saved cost based on the automated close prediction.},

abstract = {Any sufficiently complex system acts as a black box when it becomes easier to experiment with than to understand. Hence, black-box optimization has become increasingly important as systems have become more complex. In this paper we describe Google Vizier, a Google-internal service for performing black-box optimization that has become the de facto parameter tuning engine at Google. Google Vizier is used to optimize many of our machine learning models and other systems, and also provides core capabilities to Google's Cloud Machine Learning HyperTune subsystem. We discuss our requirements, infrastructure design, underlying algorithms, and advanced features such as transfer learning and automated early stopping that the service provides.},

abstract = {The benefits of the analysis of software faults and failures have been widely recognized. However, detailed studies based on empirical data are rare. In this paper, we analyze the fault and failure data from two large, real-world case studies. Specifically, we explore: 1) the localization of faults that lead to individual software failures and 2) the distribution of different types of software faults. Our results show that individual failures are often caused by multiple faults spread throughout the system. This observation is important since it does not support several heuristics and assumptions used in the past. In addition, it clearly indicates that finding and fixing faults that lead to such software failures in large, complex systems are often difficult and challenging tasks despite the advances in software development. Our results also show that requirement faults, coding faults, and data problems are the three most common types of software faults. Furthermore, these results show that contrary to the popular belief, a significant percentage of failures are linked to late life cycle activities. Another important aspect of our work is that we conduct intra- and interproject comparisons, as well as comparisons with the findings from related studies. The consistency of several main trends across software systems in this paper and several related research efforts suggests that these trends are likely to be intrinsic characteristics of software faults and failures rather than project specific.},

However, surprisingly little is known about how they are produced. What causes these power law distributions? We offer an explanation from the perspective of fine-grained code changes. A model based on preferential attachment and self-organized criticality is proposed to simulate software evolution. The experiment shows that the simulation is able to render power law distributions out of fine-grained code changes, suggesting preferential attachment and self-organized criticality are the underlying mechanism causing the power law distributions in software systems.},

abstract = {Natural languages like English are rich, complex, and powerful. The highly creative and graceful use of languages like English and Tamil, by masters like Shakespeare and Avvaiyar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice, given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most human utterances are far simpler and much more repetitive and predictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech recognition, natural language translation, question-answering, and text mining and comprehension.We begin with the conjecture that most software is also natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work, with all the attendant constraints and limitations---and thus, like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and predictable. We then proceed to ask whether (a) code can be usefully modeled by statistical language models and (b) such models can be leveraged to support software engineers. Using the widely adopted n-gram model, we provide empirical evidence supportive of a positive answer to both these questions. We show that code is also very regular, and, in fact, even more so than natural languages. As an example use of the model, we have developed a simple code completion engine for Java that, despite its simplicity, already improves Eclipse's completion capability. We conclude the paper by laying out a vision for future research in this area.},

issn = {0950-5849},
author = {Kunsong Zhao and Zhou Xu and Meng Yan and Tao Zhang and Dan Yang and Wei Li},
keywords = {Crash localization, Stack trace, Feature selection, Empirical study},
abstract = {Context:
Software crash is a serious form of the software failure, which often occurs during the software development and maintenance process. As the stack trace reported when the software crashes contains a wealth of information about crashes, recent work utilized classification models with the collected features from stack traces and source code to predict whether the fault causing the crash resides in the stack trace. This could speed-up the crash localization task.
Objective:
As the quality of features can affect the performance of the constructed classification models, researchers proposed to use feature selection methods to select a representative feature subset to build models by replacing the original features. However, only limited feature selection methods and classification models were taken into consideration for this issue in previous work. In this work, we look into this topic deeply and find out the best feature selection method for crash fault residence prediction task.
Method:
We study the performance of 24 feature selection techniques with 21 classification models on a benchmark dataset containing crash instances from 7 real-world software projects. We use 4 indicators to evaluate the performance of these feature selection methods which are applied to the classification models.
Results:
The experimental results show that, overall, a probability-based feature selection, called Symmetrical Uncertainty, performs well across the studied classification models and projects. Thus, we recommend such a feature selection method to preprocess the crash instances before constructing classification models to predict the crash fault residence.
Conclusion:
This work conducts a large-scale empirical study to investigate the impact of feature selection methods on the performance of classification models for the crashing fault residence prediction task. The results clearly demonstrate that there exist significant performance differences among these feature selection techniques across different classification models and projects.}

However, these methods do not consider the correction while computing mutual information for finite samples. Again, finding appropriate discretization of features is often a necessary step prior to feature selection. However, existing researches rarely discuss both discretization and feature selection simultaneously. To solve these issues, Joint Bias corrected Mutual Information (JBMI) is firstly proposed in this paper for feature selection. Secondly, a framework namely modified discretization and feature selection based on mutual information is proposed that incorporates JBMI based feature selection and dynamic discretization, both of which use a χ2 based searching method. Experimental results on thirty benchmark datasets show that in most of the cases, the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.}

attributes. To use such an algorithm when there are numeric attributes, all numeric
values must first be converted into discrete values--a process called discretization.

abstract = {Storing and using specific instances improves the performance of several supervised learning algorithms. These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding
the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which
is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing
whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the
model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a
trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that
explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner,
by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose
a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and
their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization
problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models
for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We
show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human
subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a
prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying
why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently achieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from massive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis. It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for downstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we take a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special relation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the crucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we comprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs are driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability of data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures, utilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting interpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open problems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and advance the future study of PTMs.}

abstract = {Creating and running software produces large amounts of raw data about the development process and the customer usage, which can be turned into actionable insight with the help of skilled data scientists. Unfortunately, data scientists with the analytical and software engineering skills to analyze these large data sets have been hard to come by; only recently have software companies started to develop competencies in software-oriented data analytics. To understand this emerging role, we interviewed data scientists across several product groups at Microsoft. In this paper, we describe their education and training background, their missions in software engineering contexts, and the type of problems on which they work. We identify five distinct working styles of data scientists: (1) Insight Providers, who work with engineers to collect the data needed to inform decisions that managers make; (2) Modeling Specialists, who use their machine learning expertise to build predictive models; (3) Platform Builders, who create data platforms, balancing both engineering and data analysis concerns; (4) Polymaths, who do all data science activities themselves; and (5) Team Leaders, who run teams of data scientists and spread best practices. We further describe a set of strategies that they employ to increase the impact and actionability of their work.},

abstract = {Software analytics has been the subject of considerable recent attention but is yet to receive significant industry traction. One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as important as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice. We outline a research roadmap for this space, building on social science, explainable artificial intelligence and software engineering.},

  abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

abstract="Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.",

abstract = {Background. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), which aims to apply defect prediction models built on source projects to a target project. Currently, a variety of (complex) CPDP models have been proposed with a promising prediction performance.Problem. Most, if not all, of the existing CPDP models are not compared against those simple module size models that are easy to implement and have shown a good performance in defect prediction in the literature.Objective. We aim to investigate how far we have really progressed in the journey by comparing the performance in defect prediction between the existing CPDP models and simple module size models.Method. We first use module size in the target project to build two simple defect prediction models, ManualDown and ManualUp, which do not require any training data from source projects. ManualDown considers a larger module as more defect-prone, while ManualUp considers a smaller module as more defect-prone. Then, we take the following measures to ensure a fair comparison on the performance in defect prediction between the existing CPDP models and the simple module size models: using the same publicly available data sets, using the same performance indicators, and using the prediction performance reported in the original cross-project defect prediction studies.Result. The simple module size models have a prediction performance comparable or even superior to most of the existing CPDP models in the literature, including many newly proposed models.Conclusion. The results caution us that, if the prediction performance is the goal, the real progress in CPDP is not being achieved as it might have been envisaged. We hence recommend that future studies should include ManualDown/ManualUp as the baseline models for comparison when developing new CPDP models to predict defects in a complete target project.},

@article{kohonen-self-organized-formation-1982,
  abstract = {{This work contains a theoretical study and computer
                 simulations of a new self-organizing process. The
                 principal discovery is that in a simple network of
                 adaptive physical elements which receives signals from
                 a primary event space, the signal representations are
                 automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in
                 such a way that the responses acquire the same
                 topological order as that of the primary events. In
                 other words, a principle has been discovered which
                 facilitates the automatic formation of topologically
                 correct maps of features of observable events. The
                 basic self-organizing system is a one- or
                 two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a
                 network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by
                 short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring
                 units. Several types of computer simulations are used
                 to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the
                 conditions under which it fails.}},

The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.},

abstract={Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97{\%}) but an inversely proportional recall (32{\%}). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82{\%}) and a high recall (86{\%}). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.},

abstract = {Links are an essential feature of the World Wide Web, and source code repositories are no exception. However, despite their many undisputed benefits, links can suffer from decay, insufficient versioning, and lack of bidirectional traceability. In this paper, we investigate the role of links contained in source code comments from these perspectives. We conducted a large-scale study of around 9.6 million links to establish their prevalence, and we used a mixed-methods approach to identify the links' targets, purposes, decay, and evolutionary aspects. We found that links are prevalent in source code repositories, that licenses, software homepages, and specifications are common types of link targets, and that links are often included to provide metadata or attribution.

abstract = {Links are an essential feature of the World Wide Web, and source code repositories are no exception. However, despite their many undisputed benefits, links can suffer from decay, insufficient versioning, and lack of bidirectional traceability. In this paper, we investigate the role of links contained in source code comments from these perspectives. We conducted a large-scale study of around 9.6 million links to establish their prevalence, and we used a mixed-methods approach to identify the links' targets, purposes, decay, and evolutionary aspects. We found that links are prevalent in source code repositories, that licenses, software homepages, and specifications are common types of link targets, and that links are often included to provide metadata or attribution. Links are rarely updated, but many link targets evolve. Almost 10% of the links included in source code comments are dead. We then submitted a batch of link-fixing pull requests to open source software repositories, resulting in most of our fixes being merged successfully. Our findings indicate that links in source code comments can indeed be fragile, and our work opens up avenues for future work to address these problems.},

title = {Active Learning for Multi-Objective Optimization},
year = {2013},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

abstract = { In continuous integration development environments, software engineers frequently integrate new or changed code with the mainline codebase. This can reduce the amount of code rework that is needed as systems evolve and speed up development time. While continuous integration processes traditionally require that extensive testing be performed following the actual submission of code to the codebase, it is also important to ensure that enough testing is performed prior to code submission to avoid breaking builds and delaying the fast feedback that makes continuous integration desirable. In this work, we present algorithms that make continuous integration processes more cost-effective. In an initial pre-submit phase of testing, developers specify modules to be tested, and we use regression test selection techniques to select a subset of the test suites for those modules that render that phase more cost-effective. In a subsequent post-submit phase of testing, where dependent modules as well as changed modules are tested, we use test case prioritization techniques to ensure that failures are reported more quickly. In both cases, the techniques we utilize are novel, involving algorithms that are relatively inexpensive and do not rely on code coverage information -- two requirements for conducting testing cost-effectively in this context. To evaluate our approach, we conducted an empirical study on a large data set from Google that we make publicly available. The results of our study show that our selection and prioritization techniques can each lead to cost-effectiveness improvements in the continuous integration process. },

abstract = {Automated UI testing is an important component of the continuous integration process of software development. A modern web-based UI is an amalgam of reports from dozens of microservices written by multiple teams. Queries on a page that opens up another will fail if any of that page's microservices fails. As a result, the overall cost for automated UI testing is high since the UI elements cannot be tested in isolation. For example, the entire automated UI testing suite at LexisNexis takes around 30 hours (3-5 hours on the cloud) to execute, which slows down the continuous integration process. To mitigate this problem and give developers faster feedback on their code, test case prioritization techniques are used to reorder the automated UI test cases so that more failures can be detected earlier. Given that much of the automated UI testing is "black box" in nature, very little information (only the test case descriptions and testing results) can be utilized to prioritize these automated UI test cases. Hence, this paper evaluates 17 "black box" test case prioritization approaches that do not rely on source code information. Among these, we propose a novel TCP approach, that dynamically re-prioritizes the test cases when new failures are detected, by applying and adapting a state of the art framework from the total recall problem. Experimental results on LexisNexis automated UI testing data show that our new approach (which we call TERMINATOR), outperformed prior state of the art approaches in terms of failure detection rates with negligible CPU overhead.},

abstract = {Research in requirements engineering has produced an extensive body of knowledge, but there are four areas in which the foundation of the discipline seems weak or obscure. This article shines some light in the “four dark corners,” exposing problems and proposing solutions. We show that all descriptions involved in requirements engineering should be descriptions of the environment. We show that certain control information is necessary for sound requirements engineering, and we explain the close association between domain knowledge and refinement of requirements. Together these conclusions explain the precise nature of requirements, specifications, and domain knowledge, as well as the precise nature of the relationships among them. They establish minimum standards for what  information should be represented in a requirements language. They also make it possible to determine exactly what it means for requirements and engineering to be successfully completed.},

abstract="This paper examines the theoretical and practical problems that arise from attempts to develop formal characterizations and explanations of many work activities, in particular, collaborative activities. We argue that even seemingly discrete individual activities occur in, and frequently draw upon a complex network of factors: individual, social and organizational. Similarly, organizational and social constraints and practices impact upon individual cognitive processes and the realization of these in specific tasks. Any adequate characterization of work activities therefore requires the analysis and synthesis of information from these traditionally separate sources. We argue that existing frameworks, emanating separately from the respective disciplines (cognitive, social and organizational) do not present an adequate means of studying the dynamics of collaborative activity in situ. An alternative framework, advocated in this paper, is distributed cognition. Its theoretical basis is outlined together with examples of applied studies of computer-mediated work activities in different organizational settings.",

number="1",
pages="39--77",
abstract="This paper provides an analysis of the behavior of separate-and-conquer or covering rule learning algorithms by visualizing their evaluation metrics and their dynamics in coverage space, a variant of ROC space. Our results show that most commonly used metrics, including accuracy, weighted relative accuracy, entropy, and Gini index, are equivalent to one of two fundamental prototypes: precision, which tries to optimize the area under the ROC curve for unknown costs, and a cost-weighted difference between covered positive and negative examples, which tries to find the optimal point under known or assumed costs. We also show that a straightforward generalization of the m-estimate trades off these two prototypes. Furthermore, our results show that stopping and filtering criteria like CN2's significance test focus on identifying significant deviations from random classification, which does not necessarily avoid overfitting. We also identify a problem with Foil's MDL-based encoding length restriction, which proves to be largely equivalent to a variable threshold on the recall of the rule. In general, we interpret these results as evidence that, contrary to common conception, pre-pruning heuristics are not very well understood and deserve more investigation.",

abstract = "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have driven impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years, exceeding human performance in domains ranging from Atari to Go to no-limit poker. This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient – that is, it may simply be too slow – to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning."

abstract="In rule discovery systems, learning often proceeds by first assessing the quality of the system's current rules and then modifying rules based on that assessment. This paper addresses the credit assignment problem that arises when long sequences of rules fire between successive external rewards. The focus is on the kinds of rule assessment schemes which have been proposed for rule discovery systems that use genetic algorithms as the primary rule modification strategy. Two distinct approaches to rule learning with genetic algorithms have been previously reported, each approach offering a useful solution to a different level of the credit assignment problem. We describe a system, called RUDI, that exploits both approaches. We present analytic and experimental results that support the hypothesis that multiple levels of credit assignment can improve the performance of rule learning systems based on genetic algorithms.",

abstract="SBSE researchers often use an evolutionary algorithm to solve various software engineering problems. This paper explores an alternate approach of sampling. This approach is called SWAY (Samplying WAY) and finds the (near) optimal solutions to the problem by (i) creating a larger initial population and (ii) intelligently sampling the solution space to find the best subspace. Unlike evolutionary algorithms, SWAY does not use mutation or cross-over or multi-generational reasoning to find interesting subspaces but relies on the underlying dimensions of the solution space. Experiments with Software Engineering (SE) models shows that SWAY's performance improvement is competitive with standard MOEAs while, terminating over an order of magnitude faster.",

@inproceedings{Weimer2009,
abstract = {Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely manual process. We introduce a fully automated method for locating and repairing bugs in software. The approach works on off-the-shelf legacy applications and does not require formal specifications, program annotations or special coding practices. Once a program fault is discovered, an extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program variants until one is found that both retains required functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode program requirements. After a successful repair has been discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging. We describe the proposed method and report experimental results demonstrating that it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling 63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.},

 abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

 abstract = {Software systems are designed and engineered to process data. However, software is data too. The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

Much of this research has been focused on determining how to use various IR techniques to support concept location. Very little attention has been given to the effect of different configurations of corpus building and indexing on query results. In this paper, we propose a tool designed to support large-scale studies of IR techniques in varying configurations of parameters with the intention of automatically calibrating these parameters. We also discuss preliminary efforts to create the benchmark data such studies require.},

 pages = {1-10},
 abstract = {One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is concept location in source code. In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.},

abstract = {Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Ma2012,
    abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built
    models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction
    models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these
    models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of
    the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has
    attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain
    using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when
    distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate
    for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we
    consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and
    target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross
    company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build
    faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior
    works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we
    proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the
    information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution
    estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company
    data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted
    data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents
    a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the
    experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It
    indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the
    receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the
    state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are
    too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful
    knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may
    help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide
    optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing
    cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process.

@article{vcboost16,
abstract = {It is well-known that software defect prediction is one of the
most important tasks for software quality improvement. The use of defect
predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby
testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance
costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there
should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model.
Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible
since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies.
Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the
difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of
imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the
performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning
can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric
misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from
distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the
appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics
test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical
significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results
show that our approach can provide higher prediction performance than both
the existing CPDP technique and the existing class imbalance technique.},

title="Negative results for software effort estimation",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2016",
pages="1--26",
abstract="More than half the literature on software effort estimation (SEE) focuses on comparisons of new estimation methods. Surprisingly, there are no studies comparing state of the art latest methods with decades-old approaches. Accordingly, this paper takes five steps to check if new SEE methods generated better estimates than older methods. Firstly, collect effort estimation methods ranging from ``classical'' COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of attributes) to ``modern'' (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering plus instance and feature selection, and a recent ``baseline method'' proposed in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering). Secondly, catalog the list of objections that lead to the development of post-COCOMO estimation methods. Thirdly, characterize each of those objections as a comparison between newer and older estimation methods. Fourthly, using four COCOMO-style data sets (from 1991, 2000, 2005, 2010) and run those comparisons experiments. Fifthly, compare the performance of the different estimators using a Scott-Knott procedure using (i) the A12 effect size to rule out ``small'' differences and (ii) a 99 {\%} confident bootstrap procedure to check for statistically different groupings of treatments. The major negative result of this paper is that for the COCOMO data sets, nothing we studied did any better than Boehms original procedure. Hence, we conclude that when COCOMO-style attributes are available, we strongly recommend (i) using that data and (ii) use COCOMO to generate predictions. We say this since the experiments of this paper show that, at least for effort estimation, how data is collected is more important than what learner is applied to that data.",

abstract     = {<p>In this paper, we present the results from two surveys
related to data science
applied to software engineering. The first survey solicited questions that
software engineers would like data scientists to investigate about software,
about software processes and practices, and about software engineers. Our
analyses resulted in a list of 145 questions grouped into 12 categories. The
second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145
questions and identify the most important ones to work on first. Respondents
favored questions that focus on how customers typically use their
applications.
We also saw opposition to questions that assess the performance of
individual
employees or compare them with one another. Our categorization and catalog
of 145
questions can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to more easily
focus
their efforts on topics that are important to the software industry.</p>

abstract = {Several code smell detection tools have been developed providing different
results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted, and hence detected, in
different ways. In this paper, we perform the largest experiment of applying machine
learning algorithms to code smells to the best of our knowledge. We experiment 16
different machine-learning algorithms on four code smells (Data Class, Large Class,
Feature Envy, Long Method) and 74 software systems, with 1986 manually validated code
smell samples. We found that all algorithms achieved high performances in the
cross-validation data set, yet the highest performances were obtained by J48 and Random
Forest, while the worst performance were achieved by support vector machines. However,
the lower prevalence of code smells, i.e., imbalanced data, in the entire data set
caused varying performances that need to be addressed in the future studies. We
conclude that the application of machine learning to the detection of these code smells
can provide high accuracy ({\textgreater}96 {\%}), and only a hundred training examples
are needed to reach at least 95 {\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Criteria for software quality measurement depend on the application area. In large software systems criteria like maintainability, comprehensibility and extensibility play an important role. My aim is to identify design flaws in software systems automatically and thus to avoid “bad” — incomprehensible, hardly expandable and changeable — program structures. Depending on the perception and experience of the searching engineer, design flaws are interpreted in a different way. I propose to combine known methods for finding design flaws on the basis of metrics with machine learning mechanisms, such that design flaw detection is adaptable to different views. This paper presents the underlying method, describes an analysis tool for Java programs and shows results of an initial case study. },

@article{vcboost16,
abstract = {It is well-known that software defect prediction is one of the
most important tasks for software quality improvement. The use of defect
predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby
testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance
costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there
should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model.
Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible
since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies.
Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the
difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of
imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the
performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning
can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric
misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from
distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the
appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics
test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical
significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results
show that our approach can provide higher prediction performance than both
the existing CPDP technique and the existing class imbalance technique.},

We use data on 154 projects from 2 sources to investigate transfer learning between different time intervals and 195 projects from 51 sources to provide evidence on the value of transfer learning for traditional cross-company learning problems. We find that the same transfer learning method can be useful for transfer effort estimation results for the cross-company learning problem and the cross-time learning problem. It is misguided to think that: (1) Old data of an organization is irrelevant to current context or (2) data of another organization cannot be used for local solutions. Transfer learning is a promising research direction that transfers relevant cross data between time intervals and domains.},

abstract = {Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the performance of cross-project defect prediction is generally poor, largely because of feature distribution differences between the source and target projects. In this paper, we apply a state-of-the-art transfer learning approach, TCA, to make feature distributions in source and target projects similar. In addition, we propose a novel transfer defect learning approach, TCA+, by extending TCA. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that TCA+ significantly improves cross-project prediction performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na{\"{\i}}ve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology and performance comprehensively.},

@article{Chen2015,
abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction has been widely studied
based on various machine-learning algorithms. Previous studies usually
focus on within-company defects prediction (WCDP), but lack of training
data in the early stages of software testing limits the efficiency of WCDP
in practice. Thus, recent research has largely examined the cross-company
defects prediction (CCDP) as an alternative solution. Objective: However,
the gap of different distributions between cross-company (CC) data and
withincompany (WC) data usually makes it difficult to build a high-quality
CCDP model. In this paper, a novel algorithm named Double Transfer
Boosting (DTB) is introduced to narrow this gap and improve the
performance of CCDP by reducing negative samples in CC data. Method: The
proposed DTB model integrates two levels of data transfer: first, the data
gravitation method reshapes the whole distribution of CC data to fit WC
data. Second, the transfer boosting method employs a small ratio of
labeled WC data to eliminate negative instances in CC data. Results: The
empirical evaluation was conducted based on 15 publicly available
datasets. CCDP experiment results indicated that the proposed model
achieved better overall performance than compared CCDP models. DTB was
also compared to WCDP in two different situations. Statistical analysis
suggested that DTB performed significantly better than WCDP models trained
by limited samples and produced comparable results to WCDP with sufficient
training data. Conclusions: DTB reforms the distribution of CC data from
different levels to improve the performance of CCDP, and experimental
results and analysis demonstrate that it could be an effective model for
early software defects detection.},

Such static code defect predictors perform well compared to manual methods, and they are easy to use and useful to use. But one of the “black arts” of data mining is setting the tunings that control the miner. Objective: We seek simple, automatic, and very effective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with different data sets (from open source \{JAVA\} systems), we ran differential evolution as an optimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then tested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior expectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required tens, not thousands, of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when learning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tunings that alter detection precision from 0% to 60%. Conclusion: Since (1) the improvements are so large, and (2) the tuning is so simple, we need to change standard methods in software analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result without conducting a tuning optimization study. The implication for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue. "

abstract = {How can we find data for quality prediction? Early in the life
cycle, projects may lack the data needed to build such predictors. Prior
work assumed that relevant training data was found nearest to the local

filter which is based on the following conjecture: When local data is
scarce, more information exists in other projects. Accordingly, this
filter selects training data via the structure of other projects. To
assess the performance of the Peters filter, we compare it with two other
approaches for quality prediction. Within-company learning and
cross-company learning with the Burak filter (the state-of-the-art
relevancy filter). This paper finds that: 1) within-company predictors are
weak for small data-sets; 2) the Peters filter+cross-company builds better
predictors than both within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company;
and 3) the Peters filter builds 64{\%} more useful predictors than both
within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company approaches. Hence, we
recommend the Peters filter for cross-company learning. {\textcopyright}

This hierarchical decomposition has a profound influence on evolvability, maintainability and work assignment. Hierarchical decomposition is thus clearly of central concern for empirical software engineering researchers; but it also poses a quandary. At what level do we study phenomena, such as quality, distribution, collaboration and productivity? At the level of files? packages? or modules? How does the level of study affect the truth, meaning, and relevance of the findings? In other fields it has been found that choosing the wrong level might lead to misleading or fallacious results. Choosing a proper level, for study, is thus vitally important for empirical software engineering research; but this issue hasn't thus far been explicitly investigated. We describe the related idea of ecological inference and ecological fallacy from sociology and epidemiology, and explore its relevance to empirical software engineering; we also present some case studies, using defect and process data from 18 open source projects to illustrate the risks of modeling at an aggregation level in the context of defect prediction, as well as in hypothesis testing.},

Aims: In this study, we aim at investigating the degree of such local bias in a cross-company historical dataset, and assessing its impacts on parametric estimation model's performance. Method: Our study consists of three parts: 1) defining a method for measuring and analyzing the local bias associated with individual organization data subset in the overall dataset; 2) assessing the impacts of local bias on the estimation performance of COCOMO II 2000 model; 3) performing a correlation analysis to verify that local bias can be harmful to the performance of a parametric estimation model. Results: Our results show that the local bias negatively impacts the performance of parametric model. Our measure of local bias has a positive correlation with the performance by statistical importance. Conclusion: Local calibration by using the whole multi-company data would get worse performance. The influence of multi-company data could be defined by local bias and be measured by our method.},

abstract = {Abstract—Data miners can infer rules showing how to improve either (a) the effort estimates of a project or (b) the defect predictions of a software module. Such studies often exhibit conclusion instability regarding what is the most effective action for different projects or modules. This instability can be explained by data heterogeneity. We show that effort and defect data contain many local regions with markedly different properties to the global space. In other words, what appears to be useful in a global context is often irrelevant for particular local contexts. This result raises questions about the generality of conclusions from empirical SE. At the very least, SE researchers should test if their supposedly general conclusions are valid within subsets of their data. At the very most, empirical SE should become a search for local regions with similar properties (and conclusions should be constrained to just those regions).},

abstract = {Much research energy in software engineering is focused on the creation of effort and defect prediction models. Such models are important means for practitioners to judge their current project situation, optimize the allocation of their resources, and make informed future decisions. However, software engineering data contains a large amount of variability. Recent research demonstrates that such variability leads to poor fits of machine learning models to the underlying data, and suggests splitting datasets into more fine-grained subsets with similar properties. In this paper, we present a comparison of three different approaches for creating statistical regression models to model and predict software defects and development effort. Global models are trained on the whole dataset. In contrast, local models are trained on subsets of the dataset. Last, we build a global model that takes into account local characteristics of the data. We evaluate the performance of these three approaches in a case study on two defect and two effort datasets. We find that for both types of data, local models show a significantly increased fit to the data compared to global models. The substantial improvements in both relative and absolute prediction errors demonstrate that this increased goodness of fit is valuable in practice. Finally, our experiments suggest that trends obtained from global models are too general for practical recommendations. At the same time, local models provide a multitude of trends which are only valid for specific subsets of the data. Instead, we advocate the use of trends obtained from global models that take into account local characteristics, as they combine the best of both worlds.},

@article{ma12,
abstract = {Context: Software defect prediction studies usually built models using within-company data, but very few focused on the prediction models trained with cross-company data. It is difficult to employ these models which are built on the within-company data in practice, because of the lack of these local data repositories. Recently, transfer learning has attracted more and more attention for building classifier in target domain using the data from related source domain. It is very useful in cases when distributions of training and test instances differ, but is it appropriate for cross-company software defect prediction? Objective: In this paper, we consider the cross-company defect prediction scenario where source and target data are drawn from different companies. In order to harness cross company data, we try to exploit the transfer learning method to build faster and highly effective prediction model. Method: Unlike the prior works selecting training data which are similar from the test data, we proposed a novel algorithm called Transfer Naive Bayes (TNB), by using the information of all the proper features in training data. Our solution estimates the distribution of the test data, and transfers cross-company data information into the weights of the training data. On these weighted data, the defect prediction model is built. Results: This article presents a theoretical analysis for the comparative methods, and shows the experiment results on the data sets from different organizations. It indicates that TNB is more accurate in terms of AUC (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), within less runtime than the state of the art methods. Conclusion: It is concluded that when there are too few local training data to train good classifiers, the useful knowledge from different-distribution training data on feature level may help. We are optimistic that our transfer learning method can guide optimal resource allocation strategies, which may reduce software testing cost and increase effectiveness of software testing process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Reliably predicting software defects is one of the holy grails of software engineering. Researchers have devised and implemented a plethora of defect/bug prediction approaches varying in terms of accuracy, complexity and the input data they require. However, the absence of an established benchmark makes it hard, if not impossible, to compare approaches. We present a benchmark for defect prediction, in the form of a publicly available dataset consisting of several software systems, and provide an extensive comparison of well-known bug prediction approaches, together with novel approaches we devised. We evaluate the performance of the approaches using different performance indicators: classification of entities as defect-prone or not, ranking of the entities, with and without taking into account the effort to review an entity. We performed three sets of experiments aimed at (1) comparing the approaches across different systems, (2) testing whether the differences in performance are statistically significant, and (3) investigating the stability of approaches across different learners. Our results indicate that, while some approaches perform better than others in a statistically significant manner, external validity in defect prediction is still an open problem, as generalizing results to different contexts/learners proved to be a partially unsuccessful endeavor.},

abstract = {Software defect information, including links between bugs and committed changes, plays an important role in software maintenance such as measuring quality and predicting defects. Usually, the links are automatically mined from change logs and bug reports using heuristics such as searching for specific keywords and bug IDs in change logs. However, the accuracy of these heuristics depends on the quality of change logs. Bird et al. found that there are many missing links due to the absence of bug references in change logs. They also found that the missing links lead to biased defect information, and it affects defect prediction performance. We manually inspected the explicit links, which have explicit bug IDs in change logs and observed that the links exhibit certain features. Based on our observation, we developed an automatic link recovery algorithm, ReLink, which automatically learns criteria of features from explicit links to recover missing links. We applied ReLink to three open source projects. ReLink reliably identified links with 89{\%} precision and 78{\%} recall on average, while the traditional heuristics alone achieve 91{\%} precision and 64{\%} recall. We also evaluated the impact of recovered links on software maintainability measurement and defect prediction, and found the results of ReLink yields significantly better accuracy than those of traditional heuristics. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Background: This paper describes an analysisthat was conducted on newly collected repository with 92 versions of 38 proprietary, open-source and academic projects. A preliminary perfomed before showed the need for a further in-depth analysis study in order to identify project clusters. Aims: The goal of this research is to perform clustering on software projects in order to identify groups of software projects with similar characteristic from the defect prediction point of view. One defect prediction model should work well for all projects that belong to such group. The existence of those groups was investigated with statistical tests and by comparing the mean value of prediction efficiency. Method: Hierarchical and k-means clustering, as well obtained clusters were investigated with as Kohonen's neural network was used to find groups of similar projects. The the discriminant analysis. For each of the identified group a statistical analysis has been conducted in order to distinguish whether this group really exists. Two defect prediction models were created for each of the identified groups. The first one was based on the projects that belong to a given group, and the second one - on all the projects. Then, both models were applied to all versions of projects from the investigated group. If the predictions from the model based on projects that belong to the identified group are significantly better than the all-projects model (the mean values were compared and statistical tests were used), we conclude that the group really exists. Results: Six different clusters were identified and the existence of two of them was statistically proven: 1) cluster proprietary B – T=19, p=0.035, r=0.40; 2) cluster proprietary/open – t(17)=3.18, p=0.05, r=0.59. The obtained effect sizes (r) represent large effects according to Cohen's benchmark, which is a substantial finding. Conclusions: The two identified clusters were described and compared with results obtained by other researchers. The results of this work makes next step towards defining formal methods of reuse defect prediction models by identifying groups of projects within which the same defect prediction model may be used. Furthermore, a method of clustering was suggested and applied.},

Objective--This short note investigates the extent to which published analyses based on the NASA defect datasets are meaningful and comparable. Method--We analyze the five studies published in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering since 2007 that have utilized these datasets and compare the two versions of the datasets currently in use. Results--We find important differences between the two versions of the datasets, implausible values in one dataset and generally insufficient detail documented on dataset preprocessing.

abstract = {Software defect prediction strives to improve software quality and testing efficiency by constructing predictive classification models from code attributes to enable a timely identification of fault-prone modules. Several classification models have been evaluated for this task. However, due to inconsistent findings regarding the superiority of one classifier over another and the usefulness of metric-based classification in general, more research is needed to improve convergence across studies and further advance confidence in experimental results. We consider three potential sources for bias: comparing classifiers over one or a small number of proprietary data sets, relying on accuracy indicators that are conceptually inappropriate for software defect prediction and cross-study comparisons, and, finally, limited use of statistical testing procedures to secure empirical findings. To remedy these problems, a framework for comparative software defect prediction experiments is proposed and applied in a large-scale empirical comparison of 22 classifiers over 10 public domain data sets from the NASA Metrics Data repository. Overall, an appealing degree of predictive accuracy is observed, which supports the view that metric-based classification is useful. However, our results indicate that the importance of the particular classification algorithm may be less than previously assumed since no significant performance differences could be detected among the top 17 classifiers.},

Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty minority class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from unbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning unbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goal is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification. We found an improvement of at least 23{\%} in the average geometric mean classification accuracy on four benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally rep- resented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting)example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (nor- mal)class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal)class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of ourmethod of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {Real software, the kind working programmers produce by the kLOC to solve real-world problems, tends to be "natural", like speech or natural language; it tends to be highly repetitive and predictable. Researchers have captured this naturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect in suggestion engines, porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom miners. This suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a good statistical language model is "unnatural" in some sense, and thus possibly suspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large corpus of bug fix commits (ca. 7,139), from 10 different Java projects, and focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic (i.e. unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Ordering files for inspection by their average entropy yields cost-effectiveness scores comparable to popular defect prediction methods. At a finer granularity, focusing on highly entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug finders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings from these bug finders using an entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid, simple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for fault-localization and searching for fixes.},

Finding Least-Cost Proofs (LCPs) for CBA systems is known to be NP-hard and has been a subject of considerable research over the past decade. In this paper, we show that approximating LCPs, within a fixed ratio bound of the optimal solution, is NP-hard, even for quite restricted subclasses of CBAs. We also consider a related problem concerned with the fine-tuning of a CBA's cost function.},

abstract="Innovative companies need an agile approach for the engineering of their product requirements, to rapidly respond to and exploit changing conditions. The agile approach to requirements must nonetheless be systematic, especially with respect to accommodating legal and nonfunctional requirements. This paper examines how to support a combination of lightweight, agile requirements which can still be systematically modeled, analyzed and changed. We propose a framework, RE-KOMBINE, which is based on a propositional language for requirements modeling called Techne. We define operations on Techne models which tolerate the presence of inconsistencies in the requirements. This paraconsistent reasoning is vital for supporting delayed commitment to particular design solutions. We evaluate these operations with an industry case study using two well-known formal analysis tools. Our evaluations show that the proposed framework scales to industry-sized requirements models, while still retaining (via propositional logic) the informality that is so useful during early requirements analysis.",

This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.",

abstract="State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",

@article{krishna17a,
	abstract = {Context: Developers use bad code smells to guide code reorganization. Yet developers, text books, tools, and researchers disagree on which bad smells are important. Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to address bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the code. Method: We introduce XTREE, a tool that analyzes a historical log of defects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes. Any bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized (since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems). Evaluation: We evaluate XTREE's recommendations for bad smell improvement against recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using multiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules that are changed in response to XTREE's recommendations contain significantly fewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE endorses changes to very few code metrics, and the bad smell recommendations (learned from previous studies) are not universal to all software projects. Conclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell report, use a tool like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are useless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is useful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code reorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic methods. This recommendation assumes that there is an historical record. If none exists, then the results of this paper could be used as a guide.},

abstract = {Data engineering is generally considered to be a central issue in the development
of data mining applications. The success of many learning schemes, in their attempts
to construct models of data, hinges on the reliable identification of a small set
of highly predictive attributes. The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and noisy
attributes in the model building process phase can result in poor predictive performance
and increased computation. Attribute selection generally involves a combination of
search and attribute utility estimation plus evaluation with respect to specific learning
schemes. This leads to a large number of possible permutations and has led to a situation
where very few benchmark studies have been conducted. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison of several attribute selection methods for supervised classification. All
the methods produce an attribute ranking, a useful devise for isolating the individual
merit of an attribute. Attribute selection is achieved by cross-validating the attribute
rankings with respect to a classification learner to find the best attributes. Results
are reported for a selection of standard data sets and two diverse learning schemes
C4.5 and naive Bayes.},

abstract = {Fault and adversary tolerance have become not only desirable but required properties of software systems because mission-critical systems are commonly distributed on large networks of insecure nodes. In this paper, we describe how the tile style, an architectural style designed to distribute computation, can inject fault and adversary tolerance. The result is a notion of tolerance that is entirely abstracted away from the functional properties of the software system. The client may specify what fraction of the network is faulty or malicious (e.g., 25%) and the acceptable system failure rate (e.g., 2-10), and the system's architecture adjusts automatically to ensure a failure rate no higher than the one specified. The technique is entirely automated and consists of a "smart redundancy" mechanism that brings the failure rate exponentially close to 0 by slowing down the execution speed linearly.},

abstract="The goal of this roadmap paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art and identify research challenges when developing, deploying and managing self-adaptive software systems. Instead of dealing with a wide range of topics associated with the field, we focus on four essential topics of self-adaptation: design space for self-adaptive solutions, software engineering processes for self-adaptive systems, from centralized to decentralized control, and practical run-time verification {\&} validation for self-adaptive systems. For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010.",

We posit that synthesizing partial component-level behavior models from these early specifications can improve software development practices. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for deriving a Modal Transition System (MTS) for individual system components from system-level scenario and property specifications. The generated MTSs capture the possible component implementations that (1) necessarily provide the behavior required by the scenarios, (2) restrict behavior forbidden by the properties, and (3) leave the behavior that is neither explicitly required nor forbidden as undefined. We also show how our algorithm helps to discover potential design flaws.},

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

abstract = {Social discrimination is said to occur when an unfavorable decision for an individual
is influenced by her membership to certain protected groups such as females and minority
ethnic groups. Such discriminatory decisions often exist in historical data. Despite
recent works in discrimination-aware data mining, there remains the need for robust,
yet easily usable, methods for discrimination control. In this paper, we utilize reject
option in classification, a general decision theoretic framework for handling instances
whose labels are uncertain, for modeling and controlling discriminatory decisions.
Specifically, this framework permits a formal treatment of the intuition that instances
close to the decision boundary are more likely to be discriminated in a dataset. Based
on this framework, we present three different solutions for discrimination-aware classification.
The first solution invokes probabilistic rejection in single or multiple probabilistic
classifiers while the second solution relies upon ensemble rejection in classifier
ensembles. The third solution integrates one of the first two solutions with situation
testing which is a procedure commonly used in the court of law. All solutions are
easy to use and provide strong justifications for the decisions. We evaluate our solutions
extensively on four real-world datasets and compare their performances with previously
proposed discrimination-aware classifiers. The results demonstrate the superiority
of our solutions in terms of both performance and flexibility of applicability. In
particular, our solutions are effective at removing illegal discrimination from the
predictions.},

abstract="With the spread of data mining technologies and the accumulation of social data, such technologies and data are being used for determinations that seriously affect individuals' lives. For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.",

abstract="State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",

Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs{\textemdash}for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

abstract = {In goal-oriented requirements engineering, goal models have been advocated to express stakeholder objectives and to capture and choose among system requirement candidates. A number of highly automated procedures have been proposed to analyze goal achievement and select alternative requirements using goal models. However, during the early stages of requirements exploration, these procedures are difficult to apply, as stakeholder goals are typically high-level, abstract, and hard-to-measure. Automated procedures often require formal representations and/or information not easily acquired in early stages (e.g., costs, temporal constraints). Consequently, early requirements engineering (RE) presents specific challenges for goal model analysis, including the need to encourage and support stakeholder involvement (through interactivity) and model improvement (through iterations). This work provides a consolidated and updated description of a framework for iterative, interactive, agent-goal model analysis for early RE. We use experiences in case studies and literature surveys to guide the design of agent-goal model analysis specific to early RE. We introduce analysis procedures for the i* goal-oriented framework, allowing users to ask "what if?" and "are certain goals achievable? how? or why not?" The i* language and our analysis procedures are formally defined. We describe framework implementation, including model visualization techniques and scalability tests. Industrial, group, and individual case studies are applied to test framework effectiveness. Contributions, including limitations and future work, are described.},

However, despite their many undisputed benefits, links can suffer from decay, insufficient versioning, and lack of bidirectional traceability. In this paper, we investigate the role of links contained in source code comments from these perspectives. We conducted a large-scale study of around 9.6 million links to establish their prevalence, and we used a mixed-methods approach to identify the links' targets, purposes, decay, and evolutionary aspects. We found that links are prevalent in source code repositories, that licenses, software homepages, and specifications are common types of link targets, and that links are often included to provide metadata or attribution. Links are rarely updated, but many link targets evolve. Almost 10% of the links included in source code comments are dead. We then submitted a batch of link-fixing pull requests to open source software repositories, resulting in most of our fixes being merged successfully. Our findings indicate that links in source code comments can indeed be fragile, and our work opens up avenues for future work to address these problems.},

abstract = {Machine learning software is increasingly being used to make decisions that affect people's lives. But sometimes, the core part of this software (the learned model), behaves in a biased manner that gives undue advantages to a specific group of people (where those groups are determined by sex, race, etc.). This "algorithmic discrimination" in the AI software systems has become a matter of serious concern in the machine learning and software engineering community. There have been works done to find "algorithmic bias" or "ethical bias" in the software system. Once the bias is detected in the AI software system, the mitigation of bias is extremely important. In this work, we a)explain how ground-truth bias in training data affects machine learning model fairness and how to find that bias in AI software,b)propose a method Fairway which combines pre-processing and in-processing approach to remove ethical bias from training data and trained model. Our results show that we can find bias and mitigate bias in a learned model, without much damaging the predictive performance of that model. We propose that (1) testing for bias and (2) bias mitigation should be a routine part of the machine learning software development life cycle. Fairway offers much support for these two purposes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how to modify the naive Bayes classifier in order to perform classification that is restricted to be independent with respect to a given sensitive attribute. Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.},

abstract = {Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated astonishing performance in many applications, there are still concerns on their dependability. One desirable property of DNN for applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e., non-discrimination). In this work, we propose a scalable approach for searching individual discriminatory instances of DNN. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which makes it significantly more scalable than existing methods. Experimental results show that our approach explores the search space more effectively (9 times) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (25 times) using much less time (half to 1/7).},

abstract = {In this paper we study the limitations of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting juvenile recidivism. Particularly, we are interested in analyzing the trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To that extent, we evaluate fairness of ML models in conjunction with SAVRY, a structured professional risk assessment framework, on a novel dataset originated in Catalonia. In terms of accuracy on the prediction of recidivism, the ML models slightly outperform SAVRY; the results improve with more data or more features available for training (AUCROC of 0.64 with SAVRY vs. AUCROC of 0.71 with ML models). However, across three fairness metrics used in other studies, we find that SAVRY is in general fair, while the ML models tend to discriminate against male defendants, foreigners, or people of specific national groups. For instance, foreigners who did not recidivate are almost twice as likely to be wrongly classified as high risk by ML models than Spanish nationals. Finally, we discuss potential sources of this unfairness and provide explanations for them, by combining ML interpretability techniques with a thorough data analysis. Our findings provide an explanation for why ML techniques lead to unfairness in data-driven risk assessment, even when protected attributes are not used in training.},

Accounts of unfair models penalizing subgroups of a population have been reported in domains including law enforcement, job screening, etc. Unfairness can spur from biases in the training data, as well as from class imbalance, i.e., when a sensitive group's data is not sufficiently represented. Under such settings, balancing techniques are commonly used to achieve better prediction performance, but their effects on model fairness are largely unknown. In this paper, we first illustrate the extent to which common balancing techniques exacerbate unfairness in real-world data. Then, we propose a new method, called fair class balancing, that allows to enhance model fairness without using any information about sensitive attributes. We show that our method can achieve accurate prediction performance while concurrently improving fairness.},

recent trend is using instance-based model-agnostic explanation methods such as LIME[36]
to find out bias in the model prediction. Our work concentrates on finding shortcomings
of current bias measures and explanation methods. We show how our proposed method
based on K nearest neighbors can overcome those shortcomings and find the underlying
bias of black box models. Our results are more trustworthy and helpful for the practitioners.
Finally, We describe our future framework combining explanation and planning to build
fair software.},

A tuple is labeled as discriminated if we can observe a significant difference of treatment among its neighbors belonging to a protected-by-law group and its neighbors not belonging to it. Discrimination discovery boils down to extracting a classification model from the labeled tuples. Discrimination prevention is tackled by changing the decision value for tuples labeled as discriminated before training a classifier. The approach of this paper overcomes legal weaknesses and technical limitations of existing proposals.},

We study the inherent tradeoffs in learning classifiers with a fairness constraint in the form of two questions: what is the best accuracy we can expect for a given level of fairness?, and what is the nature of these optimal fairness-aware classifiers? To answer these questions, we provide three main contributions. First, we relate two existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks. Second, we show that for such cost-sensitive fairness measures, the optimal classifier is an instance-dependent thresholding of the class-probability function. Third, we relate the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness to the alignment between the target and sensitive features’ class-probabilities. A practical implication of our analysis is a simple approach to the fairness-aware problem which involves suitably thresholding class-probability estimates.}

abstract = {Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.},

We formulate fairness as an optimization problem of finding a  good representation of the data with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group.  We show positive results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets.  Moreover, we demonstrate several advantages to our approach.  First, our intermediate representation can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer  learning is possible); secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important dimensions of the data for classification.}

@article{rudin2019explaining,
  abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

abstract = {Increasingly, software is making autonomous decisions in case of criminal sentencing,
approving credit cards, hiring employees, and so on. Some of these decisions show
bias and adversely affect certain social groups (e.g. those defined by sex, race,
age, marital status). Many prior works on bias mitigation take the following form:
change the data or learners in multiple ways, then see if any of that improves fairness.
Perhaps a better approach is to postulate root causes of bias and then applying some
resolution strategy. This paper postulates that the root causes of bias are the prior
decisions that affect- (a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those
examples. Our Fair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal
distributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in both positive
and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method was just as effective
at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models generated via Fair-SMOTE achieve
higher performance (measured in terms of recall and F1) than other state-of-the-art
fairness improvement algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, measured in terms of
number of analyzed learners and datasets, this study is one of the largest studies
on bias mitigation yet presented in the literature.},

abstract = { This paper defines software fairness and discrimination and develops a testing-based method for measuring if and how much software discriminates, focusing on causality in discriminatory behavior. Evidence of software discrimination has been found in modern software systems that recommend criminal sentences, grant access to financial products, and determine who is allowed to participate in promotions. Our approach, Themis, generates efficient test suites to measure discrimination. Given a schema describing valid system inputs, Themis generates discrimination tests automatically and does not require an oracle. We evaluate Themis on 20 software systems, 12 of which come from prior work with explicit focus on avoiding discrimination. We find that (1) Themis is effective at discovering software discrimination, (2) state-of-the-art techniques for removing discrimination from algorithms fail in many situations, at times discriminating against as much as 98% of an input subdomain, (3) Themis optimizations are effective at producing efficient test suites for measuring discrimination, and (4) Themis is more efficient on systems that exhibit more discrimination. We thus demonstrate that fairness testing is a critical aspect of the software development cycle in domains with possible discrimination and provide initial tools for measuring software discrimination. },

abstract = {In addition to efficient statistical estimators of a treatment's effect, successful application of causal inference requires specifying assumptions about the mechanisms underlying observed data and testing whether they are valid, and to what extent. However, most libraries for causal inference focus only on the task of providing powerful statistical estimators. We describe DoWhy, an open-source Python library that is built with causal assumptions as its first-class citizens, based on the formal framework of causal graphs to specify and test causal assumptions. DoWhy presents an API for the four steps common to any causal analysis---1) modeling the data using a causal graph and structural assumptions, 2) identifying whether the desired effect is estimable under the causal model, 3) estimating the effect using statistical estimators, and finally 4) refuting the obtained estimate through robustness checks and sensitivity analyses. In particular, DoWhy implements a number of robustness checks including placebo tests, bootstrap tests, and tests for unoberved confounding. DoWhy is an extensible library that supports interoperability with other implementations, such as EconML and CausalML for the the estimation step. The library is available at https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy.},

In this paper, we describe how the tile style, an architectural style designed to distribute computation, can inject fault and adversary tolerance. The result is a notion of tolerance that is entirely abstracted away from the functional properties of the software system. The client may specify what fraction of the network is faulty or malicious (e.g., 25%) and the acceptable system failure rate (e.g., 2-10), and the system's architecture adjusts automatically to ensure a failure rate no higher than the one specified. The technique is entirely automated and consists of a "smart redundancy" mechanism that brings the failure rate exponentially close to 0 by slowing down the execution speed linearly.},

For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010.",

In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for deriving a Modal Transition System (MTS) for individual system components from system-level scenario and property specifications. The generated MTSs capture the possible component implementations that (1) necessarily provide the behavior required by the scenarios, (2) restrict behavior forbidden by the properties, and (3) leave the behavior that is neither explicitly required nor forbidden as undefined. We also show how our algorithm helps to discover potential design flaws.},

abstract = {Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks have been shown to be susceptible to privacy attacks such as membership inference where an adversary can detect whether a data point was used for training a black-box model. Such privacy risks are exacerbated when a model’s predictions are used on an unseen data distribution. To alleviate privacy attacks, we demonstrate the benefit of predictive models that are based on the causal relationships between input features and the outcome. We first show that models learnt using causal structure generalize better to unseen data, especially on data from different distributions than the train distribution. Based on this generalization property, we establish a theoretical link between causality and privacy: compared to associational models, causal models provide stronger differential privacy guarantees and are more robust to membership inference attacks. Experiments on simulated Bayesian networks and the colored-MNIST dataset show that associational models exhibit upto 80% attack accuracy under different test distributions and sample sizes whereas causal models exhibit attack accuracy close to a random guess.},

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

abstract = {Social discrimination is said to occur when an unfavorable decision for an individual
is influenced by her membership to certain protected groups such as females and minority
ethnic groups. Such discriminatory decisions often exist in historical data. Despite
recent works in discrimination-aware data mining, there remains the need for robust,
yet easily usable, methods for discrimination control. In this paper, we utilize reject
option in classification, a general decision theoretic framework for handling instances
whose labels are uncertain, for modeling and controlling discriminatory decisions.
Specifically, this framework permits a formal treatment of the intuition that instances
close to the decision boundary are more likely to be discriminated in a dataset. Based
on this framework, we present three different solutions for discrimination-aware classification.
The first solution invokes probabilistic rejection in single or multiple probabilistic
classifiers while the second solution relies upon ensemble rejection in classifier
ensembles. The third solution integrates one of the first two solutions with situation
testing which is a procedure commonly used in the court of law. All solutions are
easy to use and provide strong justifications for the decisions. We evaluate our solutions
extensively on four real-world datasets and compare their performances with previously
proposed discrimination-aware classifiers. The results demonstrate the superiority
of our solutions in terms of both performance and flexibility of applicability. In
particular, our solutions are effective at removing illegal discrimination from the
predictions.},

For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.",

abstract="State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",

Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs{\textemdash}for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

abstract = {Machine learning software is increasingly being used to make decisions that affect people's lives. But sometimes, the core part of this software (the learned model), behaves in a biased manner that gives undue advantages to a specific group of people (where those groups are determined by sex, race, etc.). This "algorithmic discrimination" in the AI software systems has become a matter of serious concern in the machine learning and software engineering community. There have been works done to find "algorithmic bias" or "ethical bias" in the software system. Once the bias is detected in the AI software system, the mitigation of bias is extremely important. In this work, we a)explain how ground-truth bias in training data affects machine learning model fairness and how to find that bias in AI software,b)propose a method Fairway which combines pre-processing and in-processing approach to remove ethical bias from training data and trained model. Our results show that we can find bias and mitigate bias in a learned model, without much damaging the predictive performance of that model. We propose that (1) testing for bias and (2) bias mitigation should be a routine part of the machine learning software development life cycle. Fairway offers much support for these two purposes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate how to modify the naive Bayes classifier in order to perform classification that is restricted to be independent with respect to a given sensitive attribute. Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.},

One desirable property of DNN for applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e., non-discrimination). In this work, we propose a scalable approach for searching individual discriminatory instances of DNN. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which makes it significantly more scalable than existing methods. Experimental results show that our approach explores the search space more effectively (9 times) and generates much more individual discriminatory instances (25 times) using much less time (half to 1/7).},

abstract = {In this paper we study the limitations of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predicting juvenile recidivism. Particularly, we are interested in analyzing the trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To that extent, we evaluate fairness of ML models in conjunction with SAVRY, a structured professional risk assessment framework, on a novel dataset originated in Catalonia. In terms of accuracy on the prediction of recidivism, the ML models slightly outperform SAVRY; the results improve with more data or more features available for training (AUCROC of 0.64 with SAVRY vs. AUCROC of 0.71 with ML models). However, across three fairness metrics used in other studies, we find that SAVRY is in general fair, while the ML models tend to discriminate against male defendants, foreigners, or people of specific national groups. For instance, foreigners who did not recidivate are almost twice as likely to be wrongly classified as high risk by ML models than Spanish nationals. Finally, we discuss potential sources of this unfairness and provide explanations for them, by combining ML interpretability techniques with a thorough data analysis. Our findings provide an explanation for why ML techniques lead to unfairness in data-driven risk assessment, even when protected attributes are not used in training.},

In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.}",

Accounts of unfair models penalizing subgroups of a population have been reported in domains including law enforcement, job screening, etc. Unfairness can spur from biases in the training data, as well as from class imbalance, i.e., when a sensitive group's data is not sufficiently represented. Under such settings, balancing techniques are commonly used to achieve better prediction performance, but their effects on model fairness are largely unknown. In this paper, we first illustrate the extent to which common balancing techniques exacerbate unfairness in real-world data. Then, we propose a new method, called fair class balancing, that allows to enhance model fairness without using any information about sensitive attributes. We show that our method can achieve accurate prediction performance while concurrently improving fairness.},

  abstract = 	 {Binary classifiers are often required to possess fairness in the sense of not overly discriminating with respect to a feature deemed sensitive e.g. race. We study the inherent tradeoffs in learning classifiers with a fairness constraint in the form of two questions: what is the best accuracy we can expect for a given level of fairness?, and what is the nature of these optimal fairness-aware classifiers? To answer these questions, we provide three main contributions. First, we relate two existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks. Second, we show that for such cost-sensitive fairness measures, the optimal classifier is an instance-dependent thresholding of the class-probability function. Third, we relate the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness to the alignment between the target and sensitive features’ class-probabilities. A practical implication of our analysis is a simple approach to the fairness-aware problem which involves suitably thresholding class-probability estimates.}

abstract = {Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.},

abstract = {Recent work on fairness in machine learning has focused on various statistical discrimination criteria and how they trade off. Most of these criteria are observational: They depend only on the joint distribution of predictor, protected attribute, features, and outcome. While convenient to work with, observational criteria have severe inherent limitations that prevent them from resolving matters of fairness conclusively.Going beyond observational criteria, we frame the problem of discrimination based on protected attributes in the language of causal reasoning. This viewpoint shifts attention from "What is the right fairness criterion?" to "What do we want to assume about our model of the causal data generating process?" Through the lens of causality, we make several contributions. First, we crisply articulate why and when observational criteria fail, thus formalizing what was before a matter of opinion. Second, our approach exposes previously ignored subtleties and why they are fundamental to the problem. Finally, we put forward natural causal non-discrimination criteria and develop algorithms that satisfy them.},

abstract = {How do we learn from biased data? Historical datasets often reflect historical prejudices; sensitive or protected attributes may affect the observed treatments and outcomes. Classification algorithms tasked with predicting outcomes accurately from these datasets tend to replicate these biases. We advocate a causal modeling approach to learning from biased data, exploring the relationship between fair classification and intervention. We propose a causal model in which the sensitive attribute confounds both the treatment and the outcome. Building on prior work in deep learning and generative modeling, we describe how to learn the parameters of this causal model from observational data alone, even in the presence of unobserved confounders. We show experimentally that fairness-aware causal modeling provides better estimates of the causal effects between the sensitive attribute, the treatment, and the outcome. We further present evidence that estimating these causal effects can help learn policies that are both more accurate and fair, when presented with a historically biased dataset.},

abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.}

Second, these models are a special case of the more general structural equation procedures with latent variables that are discussed in the chapter. The major topics of the chapter-model specification, the implied covariance matrix, identification, and estimation—will recur for the other models. The maximum likelihood (ML) and generalized least squares (GLS) ones are asymptotically efficient when the assumption of multinormality holds or when the distribution of the variables have normal kurtosis, whereas the unweighted least squares (ULS) generally is inefficient. The chapter discusses several other topics that arise when utilizing observed variable models. These are standardized and unstandardized coefficients, alternative assumptions for x, interaction terms, and equations with intercepts.}
