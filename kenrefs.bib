abstract = {Random projections have recently emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction. Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burden-some computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

In practice, this means summarizing large data sets to find the data that really matters. Most data miners are zealous hunters seeking detailed summaries and generating extensive and lengthy descriptions. The authors take a different approach and assume that busy people don't need or can't use complex models. Rather, they want only the data they need to achieve the most benefits.Instead of finding extensive descriptions of things, their data mining tool hunts for a minimal difference set between things because they believe a list of essential differences is easier to read and understand than detailed descriptions.},

abstract = {For real-world concept learning problems, feature selection is important to speed up learning and to improve concept quality. We review and analyze past approaches to feature selection and note their strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce and theoretically examine a new algorithm Rellef which selects relevant features using a statistical method. Relief does not depend on heuristics, is accurate even if features interact, and is noise-tolerant. It requires only linear time in the number of given features and the number of training instances, regardless of the target concept complexity. The algorithm also has certain limitations such as nonoptimal feature set size. Ways to overcome the limitations are suggested. We also report the test results of comparison between Relief and other feature selection algorithms. The empirical results support the theoretical analysis, suggesting a practical approach to feature selection for real-world problems.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Random projections have recently emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction. Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burden-some computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

In practice, this means summarizing large data sets to find the data that really matters. Most data miners are zealous hunters seeking detailed summaries and generating extensive and lengthy descriptions. The authors take a different approach and assume that busy people don't need or can't use complex models. Rather, they want only the data they need to achieve the most benefits.Instead of finding extensive descriptions of things, their data mining tool hunts for a minimal difference set between things because they believe a list of essential differences is easier to read and understand than detailed descriptions.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

volume="58",
number="1",
pages="39--77",
abstract="This paper provides an analysis of the behavior of separate-and-conquer or covering rule learning algorithms by visualizing their evaluation metrics and their dynamics in coverage space, a variant of ROC space. Our results show that most commonly used metrics, including accuracy, weighted relative accuracy, entropy, and Gini index, are equivalent to one of two fundamental prototypes: precision, which tries to optimize the area under the ROC curve for unknown costs, and a cost-weighted difference between covered positive and negative examples, which tries to find the optimal point under known or assumed costs. We also show that a straightforward generalization of the m-estimate trades off these two prototypes. Furthermore, our results show that stopping and filtering criteria like CN2's significance test focus on identifying significant deviations from random classification, which does not necessarily avoid overfitting. We also identify a problem with Foil's MDL-based encoding length restriction, which proves to be largely equivalent to a variable threshold on the recall of the rule. In general, we interpret these results as evidence that, contrary to common conception, pre-pruning heuristics are not very well understood and deserve more investigation.",

abstract="Despite its simplicity, the naive Bayes learning scheme performs well on most classification tasks, and is often significantly more accurate than more sophisticated methods. Although the probability estimates that it produces can be inaccurate, it often assigns maximum probability to the correct class. This suggests that its good performance might be restricted to situations where the output is categorical. It is therefore interesting to see how it performs in domains where the predicted value is numeric, because in this case, predictions are more sensitive to inaccurate probability estimates.",

year = {1999},

publisher = {Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.},
address = {USA},
abstract = {As the application of object technology--particularly the Java programming language--has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple--seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay.In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language. 0201485672B04062001}

abstract = {Machines and people have complementary skills in Knowledge Discovery. Automated techniques can process enormous amounts of data to find new relationships, but generally these are represented by fairly simple models. On the other hand people are endlessly inventive in creating models to explain data at hand, but have problems developing consistent overall models to explain all the data that might occur in a domain; and the larger the model, the more difficult it becomes to maintain consistency. Ripple-Down Rules is a technique that has been developed to allow people to make real-time updates to a model whenever they notice some data that the model does not yet explain, while at the same time maintaining consistency. This allows an entire knowledge base to be built while it is already in use by making updates. There are now 100s of Ripple-Down-Rule knowledge bases in use and this paper presents some observations from log files tracking how people build these systems, and also outlines some recent research on how such techniques can be used to add greater specificity to the simpler models developed by automated techniques.},

abstract = {The next release problem (NRP) consists of selecting which requirements will be implemented in the next release of a software system. For many search based software engineering approaches to the NRP, there is still a lack of capability to efficiently incorporate human experience and preferences in the search process. Therefore, this paper proposes an architecture to deal with this issue, where the decision maker (DM) and his/her tacit assessments are taken into account during the solutions evaluations alongside the interactive genetic algorithm. Furthermore, a learning model is employed to avoid an overwhelming number of interactions. An empirical study involving software engineer practitioners, different instances, and different machine learning techniques was performed to assess the feasibility of the architecture to incorporate human knowledge in the overall optimization process. Obtained results indicate the architecture can assist the DM in selecting a set of requirements that properly incorporate his/her expertise, while optimizing other explicit measurable aspects equally important to the next release planning. On a scale of 0 (very ineffective) to 5 (very effective), all participants found the experience of interactively selecting the requirements using the approach as a 4 (effective).},

booktitle="Advances in Artificial Intelligence",

abstract="Predictive accuracy has been widely used as the main criterion for comparing the predictive ability of classification systems (such as C4.5, neural networks, and Naive Bayes). Most of these classifiers also produce probability estimations of the classification, but they are completely ignored in the accuracy measure. This is often taken for granted because both training and testing sets only provide class labels. In this paper we establish rigourously that, even in this setting, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply AUC, provides a better measure than accuracy. Our result is quite significant for three reasons. First, we establish, for the first time, rigourous criteria for comparing evaluation measures for learning algorithms. Second, it suggests that AUC should replace accuracy when measuring and comparing classification systems. Third, our result also prompts us to re-evaluate many well-established conclusions based on accuracy in machine learning. For example, it is well accepted in the machine learning community that, in terms of predictive accuracy, Naive Bayes and decision trees are very similar. Using AUC, however, we show experimentally that Naive Bayes is significantly better than the decision-tree learning algorithms.",

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

abstract="With the spread of data mining technologies and the accumulation of social data, such technologies and data are being used for determinations that seriously affect individuals' lives. For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques. Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on. Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.",

abstract="State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",

Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs{\textemdash}for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

@article{kiran_jmlr,
	Abstract = {Large-scale scientific workflows rely heavily on high-performance file transfers. These transfers require strict quality parameters such as guaranteed bandwidth, no packet loss or data duplication. To have successful file transfers, methods such as predetermined thresholds and statistical analysis need to be done to determine abnormal patterns. Network administrators routinely monitor and analyze network data for diagnosing and alleviating these, making decisions based on their experience. However, as networks grow and become complex, monitoring large data files and quickly processing them, makes it improbable to identify errors and rectify these. Abnormal file transfers have been classified by simply setting alert thresholds, via tools such as PerfSonar and TCP statistics (Tstat). This paper investigates the feasibility of unsupervised feature extraction methods for identifying network anomaly patterns with three unsupervised classification methods---principal component analysis, autoencoder and isolation forest. We collect file transfer statistics from two experiment sets---synthetic iPerf generated traffic and 1000 Genome workflow runs, with synthetically introduced anomalies. Our results show that while PCA and a simple autoencoder finds it difficult to detect clusters, the tree-variant isolation forest is able to identify anomalous packets by breaking down TCP traces into tree classes early.},
