Human-level measures & 
\bi 
\item Demographics about teams: size of teams; years of experience with each other; etc. 
 \item 
 Demographics about individuals: age, gender, racial background, veteran status, accessible challenges, years of experience with the case study being used; etc.
\ei
&
\bi 
\item Time to recognize a requirements violation in the simulation;
\item Time to resolve that violation;
\item Number of delayed actions per minute;
\item  Number of forgotten  actions per minute;
\item Number of interrupted actions per minute;
\item Average interruption time (seconds per minutes)
 \item Cognitive load on the human. \ei\\
 \rowcolor{blue!10}  Domain-specific measures 
 (different case studies may have    different domain-specific success
criteria). & 
For example:
\bi 
\item 
Types and size (number of words) of electronic footprint available  per team member.
\item 
Size of requirements models; e.g. number of variables; number of constraints; 
average constraints per variable; etc.
\item Nature of the goal space; e.g. how many objectives; how many objectives are conflicting; etc. 
\ei & For example:
\bi 
\item When delivering packages for Amazon, the goal might be 
{\em most} packages delivered in {\em least} time by {\em fewest} drones.
\item for emergency response groups fighting  a brush fire,
the goals might be 
{\em minimize} the property damage  during  simulation of a brush fire while
also 
{\em minimizing } the lives lost or injured during the simulation of the brush fire. \ei\\
Domain-general measures 
(these should apply to most case studies)
& Amount of ``stress'' in the simulation. Recall {\em m-of-n} studies
can be stressed in various ways such as decreasing the number of $N$ humans,
increasing the number of $N$ drones; decreasing the required response time; increasing the number of
problems injected into a simulation.
&
The following are goals for the multi-objective simulation.
\bi 
\item {\em  Minimizing} acceleration stress on the drone rotors ;
\item {\em Maximize}   battery reserves when drones return to base;

\item 
{\em Acceptance metrics}:Using
post-surveys,  capture   concerns from stakeholders about the acceptability of our final models.
\item 
{\em Nonhuman-y metrics}: To calibrate and baseline the ADVICE y-metrics, we collect output y values seen
in AI tools that make all the decisions themselves, with no human involvement (e.g. FLASH, HYPEROPT and OPTUNA~\cite{bergstra2015hyperopt,nair18,akiba2019optuna});
\item {\em Initial and final divergence metrics}:   Looking at PSO particles,
measure  
divergence between team members before and after inference (ideally,   difference decreases from initial to final).
